The main effort is focused on the user interface that allows specifying a task into a 3D model and sending commands to the real robot once the operator approves them. This kind of interaction has the ability to consume very little bandwidth in order to perform a remote manipulation through the Internet. The user interface offers Augmented and Virtual Reality possibilities to the users.",

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery with preoperative imaging data for planning have become increasingly common for surgical treatment of patients. For surgeons using robotic surgical platforms, maintaining spatial awareness of the anatomical structures in the surgical area is key for good outcomes. We propose a Mixed Reality system which allows surgeons to visualize and interact with aligned anatomical models extracted from preoperative imagery as well as the in vivo imagery from the stereo laparoscope. To develop this system, we have employed techniques to 3D reconstruct stereo laparoscope images, model 3D shape of the anatomical structures from preoperative MRI stack and align the two 3D surfaces. The application we have developed allows surgeons to visualize occluded and obscured organ boundaries as well as other important anatomy that is not visible through the laparoscope alone, facilitating better spatial awareness during surgery. The system was deployed in 9 robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy procedures as part of a feasibility study.",

However, the implementation of these types of events is complicated by the lack of appropriate direction and execution environments that can deal with the complexity of these productions. This paper seeks to address this problem by describing CHOROS, a Java-based environment for authoring, direction and control of narrative performances. In particular, CHOROS allows the story author to annotate the performance script with stage directions. Furthermore, the environment offers to the performance director an augmented reality interface for planning the behavior of the actors. Finally, the system uses vision-based tracking methods and behavior-based control for adjusting the behavior of the robotic actors according to the director instructions during the performance.",

    "abstract": "The visualization of remote surgical scenes is the key to realizing the remote operation of surgical robots. However, current non-endoscopic surgical robot systems lack an effective visualization tool to offer sufficient surgical scene information and depth perception. We propose a novel autostereoscopic surgical visualization system integrating 3D intraoperative scene reconstruction, autostereoscopic 3D display, and augmented reality-based image fusion. The preoperative organ structure and the intraoperative surface point cloud are obtained from medical imaging and the RGB-D camera, respectively, and aligned by an automatic marker-free intraoperative registration algorithm. After registration, preoperative meshes with precalculated illumination and intraoperative textured point cloud are blended in real time. Finally, the fused image is shown on a 3D autostereoscopic display device to achieve depth perception. A prototype of the autostereoscopic surgical visualization system was built. The system had a horizontal image resolution of 1.31 mm, a vertical image resolution of 0.82 mm, an average rendering rate of 33.1 FPS, an average registration rate of 20.5 FPS, and average registration errors of approximately 3 mm. A telesurgical robot prototype based on 3D autostereoscopic display was built. The quantitative evaluation experiments showed that our system achieved similar operational accuracy (1.79 ± 0.87 mm) as the conventional system (1.95 ± 0.71 mm), while having advantages in terms of completion time (with 34.11% reduction) and path length (with 35.87% reduction). Post-experimental questionnaires indicated that the system was user-friendly for novices and experts. We propose a 3D surgical visualization system with augmented instruction and depth perception for telesurgery. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation results illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system. Therefore, it shows great prospects in robotic surgery and telesurgery.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to propose a Deep Learning (DL) and Augmented Reality (AR) based solution for a in-vivo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), to improve the precision of a published work from our group. We implemented a two-steps automatic system to align a 3D virtual ad-hoc model of a patient’s organ with its 2D endoscopic image, to assist surgeons during the procedure. This approach was carried out using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based structure for semantic segmentation and a subsequent elaboration of the obtained output, which produced the needed parameters for attaching the 3D model. We used a dataset obtained from 5 endoscopic videos (A, B, C, D, E), selected and tagged by our team’s specialists. We then evaluated the most performing couple of segmentation architecture and neural network and tested the overlay performances. U-Net stood out as the most effecting architectures for segmentation. ResNet and MobileNet obtained similar Intersection over Unit (IoU) results but MobileNet was able to elaborate almost twice operations per seconds. This segmentation technique outperformed the results from the former work, obtaining an average IoU for the catheter of 0.894 (σ = 0.076) compared to 0.339 (σ = 0.195). This modifications lead to an improvement also in the 3D overlay performances, in particular in the Euclidean Distance between the predicted and actual model’s anchor point, from 12.569 (σ= 4.456) to 4.160 (σ = 1.448) and in the Geodesic Distance between the predicted and actual model’s rotations, from 0.266 (σ = 0.131) to 0.169 (σ = 0.073). This work is a further step through the adoption of DL and AR in the surgery domain. In future works, we will overcome the limits of this approach and finally improve every step of the surgical procedure.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) using the da Vinci surgical robot is a common treatment for organ-confined prostate cancer. Augmented reality (AR) can help during RALRP by showing the surgeon the location of anatomical structures and tumors from preoperative imaging. Previously, we proposed hand-eye and camera intrinsic matrix estimation procedures that can be carried out with conventional instruments within the patient during surgery, take < 3 min to perform, and fit seamlessly in the existing surgical workflow. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a complete AR guidance system for RALRP and quantify its accuracy. Methods Our AR system requires three transformations: the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to da Vinci transformation, the camera intrinsic matrix, and the hand-eye transformation. For evaluation, a 3D-printed cross-wire was visualized in TRUS and stereo endoscope in a water bath. Manually triangulated cross-wire points from stereo images were used as ground truth to evaluate overall TRE between these points and points transformed from TRUS to camera. Results After transforming the ground-truth points from the TRUS to the camera coordinate frame, the mean target registration error (TRE) (SD) was $$4.56\\pm 1.57$$ 4.56 ± 1.57  mm. The mean TREs (SD) in the x -, y -, and z -directions are $$1.93\\pm 1.26$$ 1.93 ± 1.26 mm, $$2.04\\pm 1.37$$ 2.04 ± 1.37 mm, and $$2.94\\pm 1.84$$ 2.94 ± 1.84 mm, respectively. Conclusions We describe and evaluate a complete AR guidance system for RALRP which can augment preoperative data to endoscope camera image, after a deformable magnetic resonance image to TRUS registration step. The streamlined procedures with current surgical workflow and low TRE demonstrate the compatibility and readiness of the system for clinical translation. A detailed sensitivity study remains part of future work.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Surgical treatments for low-rectal cancer require careful considerations due to the low location of cancer in rectums. Successful surgical outcomes highly depend on surgeons’ ability to determine clear distal margins of rectal tumors. This is a challenge for surgeons in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, since tumors are often concealed in rectums and robotic surgical instruments do not provide tactile feedback for tissue diagnosis in real time. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an intraoperative ultrasound-based augmented reality framework for surgical guidance in robot-assisted rectal surgery. Methods Framework implementation consists in calibrating the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and the endoscopic camera (hand-eye calibration), generating a virtual model and registering it to the endoscopic image via optical tracking, and displaying the augmented view on a head-mounted display. An experimental validation setup is designed to evaluate the framework. Results The evaluation process yields a mean error of 0.9 mm for the TRUS calibration, a maximum error of 0.51 mm for the hand-eye calibration of endoscopic cameras, and a maximum RMS error of 0.8 mm for the whole framework. In the experiment with a rectum phantom, our framework guides the surgeon to accurately localize the simulated tumor and the distal resection margin. Conclusions This framework is developed with our clinical partner, based on actual clinical conditions. The experimental protocol and the high level of accuracy show the feasibility of seamlessly integrating this framework within the surgical workflow.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we proposed an Assisted UAV Tele-Operation System, specifically for FPV navigation based on Artificial Landmarks in obstacle free environments. The system estimates the optimal path through landmarks and traces an artificial route to be followed. Path recognition uses color space and morphological transformation such as eroding and dilating to reduce noise due to different lighting environments. Once path is recognized ORB detector is used for getting a set of the most representative pixels coordinates, this is done for each ROI (Region of Interest) in the camera image. Later, the median of each pixel coordinate in the specific ROI is considered for interpolation needed to trace the route. Parrot’s drone Bebop 2 was used for the purpose of this study as it has a fisheye lens camera that allows us to face downwards to detect the landmarks.",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with the utilisation of augmented reality on the operator control panel of a teleoperated mobile robot. The work is a continuation of the previous research, which resulted in the creation and successful practical implementation of a virtual operator station based on the virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD) Oculus Rift. The new approach suggests using the new Microsoft Hololens augmented reality headset to add the virtual control elements directly to the real world, which has some very important benefits – especially the fact that the operator is not visually isolated from his surroundings. The device is introduced in the beginning of the article and then follows the description of all tasks required to create the augmented reality operator station. Mentioned are also other possible ways of using augmented reality to assist the operator of a mobile robot.",

The purpose of this study is to test the platform and the augmented reality in real environments and how it can be used effectively and without complications by elderly people.

    "abstract": "In most robot-assisted surgical interventions, multimodal fusion of pre- and intra-operative data is highly valuable, affording the surgeon a more comprehensive understanding of the surgical scene observed through the stereo endoscopic camera. More specifically, in the case of partial nephrectomy, fusing pre-operative segmentations of kidney and tumor with the stereo endoscopic view can guide tumor localization and the identification of resection margins. However, the surgeons are often unable to reliably assess the levels of trust they can bestow on what is overlaid on the screen. In this paper, we present the proof-of-concept of an uncertainty-encoded augmented reality framework and novel visualizations of the uncertainties derived from the pre-operative CT segmentation onto the surgeon’s stereo endoscopic view. To verify its clinical potential, the proposed method is applied to an ex vivo lamb kidney. The results are contrasted to different visualization solutions based on crisp segmentation demonstrating that our method provides valuable additional information that can help the surgeon during the resection planning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNew technologies can considerably improve preoperative planning, enhance the surgeon’s skill and simplify the approach to complex procedures. Augmented reality techniques, robot assisted operations and computer assisted navigation tools will become increasingly important in surgery and in residents’ education.MethodsWe obtained 3D reconstructions from simple spiral computed tomography (CT) slides using OsiriX, an open source processing software package dedicated to DICOM images. These images were then projected on the patient's body with a beamer fixed to the operating table to enhance spatial perception during surgical intervention (augmented reality).ResultsChanging a window's deepness level allowed the surgeon to navigate through the patient's anatomy, highlighting regions of interest and marked pathologies. We used image overlay navigation for laparoscopic operations such cholecystectomy, abdominal exploration, distal pancreas resection and robotic liver resection.ConclusionsAugmented reality techniques will transform the behaviour of surgeons, making surgical interventions easier, faster and probably safer. These new techniques will also renew methods of surgical teaching, facilitating transmission of knowledge and skill to young surgeons.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) provides an ideal environment for using Augmented Reality (AR) for performing image guided surgery. Seamless synthesis of AR depends on a number of factors relating to the way in which virtual objects appear and visually interact with a real environment. Traditional overlaid AR approaches generally suffer from a loss of depth perception. This paper presents a new AR method for robotic assisted MIS, which uses a novel pq-space based non-photorealistic rendering technique for providing see-through vision of the embedded virtual object whilst maintaining salient anatomical details of the exposed anatomical surface. Experimental results with both phantom and in vivo lung lobectomy data demonstrate the visual realism achieved for the proposed method and its accuracy in providing high fidelity AR depth perception.",

    "abstract": "The current industrial scenario demands advances that depend on expensive and sophisticated solutions. Augmented Reality (AR) can complement, with virtual elements, the real world. Faced with this features, an AR experience can meet the demand for prototype testing and new solutions, predicting problems and failures that may only exist in real situations. This work presents an environment for experimentation of advanced behaviors in smart factories, allowing experimentation with multi-robot systems (MRS), interconnected, cooperative, and interacting with virtual elements. The concept of ARENA introduces a novel approach to realistic and immersive experimentation in industrial environments, aiming to evaluate new technologies aligned with the Industry 4.0. The proposed method consists of a small-scale warehouse, inspired in a real scenario characterized in this paper, managing by a group of autonomous forklifts, fully interconnected, which are embodied by a swarm of tiny robots developed and prepared to operate in the small scale scenario. The AR is employed to enhance the capabilities of swarm robots, allowing box handling and virtual forklifts. Virtual laser range finders (LRF) are specially designed as segmentation of a global RGB-D camera, to improve robot perception, allowing obstacle avoidance and environment mapping. This infrastructure enables the evaluation of new strategies to improve manufacturing productivity, without compromising the production by automation faults.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lack of situation awareness significantly decreases the performance in missions where a mobile robot is operated by a human from remote. The user interface is a key influencing element for situation awareness of the human operator. The information from the remote site is limited to what the robot's sensors can provide. In addition, this information is in general only delivered with a certain - maybe varying - communication delay. Predictive displays provide a promising approach to cope with these problems. In order to increase the situation awareness for the human operator in teleoperation scenarios predictive user interfaces can be used to achieve an artificial excoentric view. This work presents an approach how a predictive mixed reality user interface can be realized with the help of motion control theory. The human operator commands a virtual robot projected into the camera image delivered to the human operator from the physical robot. Hereby a trajectory for the real physical robot is generated, which is executed by the physical robot after a certain time. Combined with mixed reality technologies an artificial, exocentric view of the mobile robot is achieved which leads to a short time predictive user interface for mobile-robot teleoperation.",

The use of augmented layers is proposed to represent laser measurements suitably aligned to video information. This methodology enables an operator to intuitively comprehend object proximity and to respond in an accurate and timely manner. The use of augmented reality to assist teleoperation, sometime discussed in the literature, is here proposed following a systematic approach and developed based on authors' previous work on stereoscopic teleoperation. The approach is experimented on a real telerobotic system where a user operates a mobile robot located thousands kilometers away. The result proved feasibility and simplicity of the proposed methodology and it represents a base for further studies.",

Extending the capabilities of these robots usually requires either purchasing or prototyping new sensors or actuators (a costly and time-consuming process), often before even knowing whether these new sensors or actuators will be able to perform the necessary task effectively. This paper presents a software platform that enables researchers to prototype new sensors and actuators in the virtual world, eliminating the time and resources necessary to prototype physical hardware, and allows for experiments to be run in as many configurations as required in order to determine the efficacy of the proposed sensor/actuator.",

    "abstract": "The continuous progress in the field of robotics and the diffusion of its related application scenarios in today’s modern world makes human interaction and communication with robots an aspect of fundamental importance. The development of interfaces based on natural interaction paradigms is getting an increasingly captivating topic in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), due to their intrinsic capabilities in providing ever more intuitive and effective control modalities. Teleoperation systems require to handle a non-negligible amount of information coming from on-board sensors as well as input devices, thus increasing the workload of remote users. This paper presents the design of a 3D User Interface (3DUI) for the control of teleoperated robotic platforms aimed at increasing the interaction efficiency. A hand gesture driven controller is used as input modality to naturally map the position and gestures of the user’s hand to suitable commands for controlling the platform components. The designed interface leverages on mixed reality to provide a visual feedback to the control commands issued by the user. The visualization of the 3DUI is superimposed to the video stream provided by an on-board camera. A user study confirmed that the proposed solution is able to improve the interaction efficiency by significantly reducing the completion time for tasks assigned in a remote reach-and-pick scenario.",

In this paper we attempt to clarify the definition of mixed reality as a more abstract concept of combining the real and virtual worlds – that is, mixed reality is not a given technology but a concept that considers how the virtual and real worlds can be combined. Further, we use this discussion to posit robots as mixed-reality devices, and present a set of implications and questions for what this implies for mixed-reality interaction with robots.",

    "abstract": "Human-Robot Interaction poses significant research challenges. Recent research suggests that rsonalisation and individualisation are key factors for establishing lifelong human-robot relationships. This raises difficulties as roboticists seek to incorporate robots into the digital society where an creasing amount of human activities relies on digital technologies and ubiquitous infrastructures. In essence, a robot may be perceived as either an embedded or mobile artefact in an arbitrary environment that must be interacted with in a seamless and intuitive fashion. This chapter explores some of the ternative ways and the design ssues to achieve these objectives. Specifically, it describes a new system, which we call Mixed Reality Agent (MiRA) Chameleon, that combines the latest advancements on agent-based ubiquitous architectures with mixed reality technology to deliver personalised and ubiquitous robot agents.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel Human-Robot Interface (HRI) that uses a Mixed Reality (MR) space to enhance and visualize object detection for mobile robot navigation. The MR space combines the 3D virtual model of a mobile robot and its navigating environment with the real data such as physical building measurement, the real-time acquired robot’s position and laser scanned points. The huge amount of laser scanned points are rapidly segmented as belonging either to the background (i.e. fixed building) or newly appeared objects by comparing them with the 3D virtual model. This segmentation result can not only accelerate the object detection process but also facilitate the further process of object recognition with significant reduction of redundant sensor data. Such a MR space can also help human operators realizing effective surveillance through real-time visualization of the object detection results. It can be applied in a variety of mobile robot applications in a known environment. Experimental results verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Robotic surgery bedside assistants play an important role in robotic procedures by performing intra-corporeal tasks while accommodating the physical presence of the robot. We hypothesized that an augmented reality headset enabling 3D intra-corporeal vision while facing the surgical field could decrease time and improve accuracy of robotic bedside tasks. Bedside assistants (one physician assistant, one medical student, three surgical trainees, and two attending surgeons) performed validated tasks within a mock abdominal cavity with a surgical robot docked. Tasks were performed with a bedside monitor providing 2D or 3D vision, or an optical see-through head-mounted augmented reality device with 2D or 3D vision. The effect of augmented reality device resolution on performance was also evaluated. For the simplest task of touching a straw, performance was generally high, regardless of mode of visualization. With more complex tasks, including stapling and pulling a ring along a path, 3D augmented reality decreased time and number of errors per task. 3D augmented reality allowed the physician assistant to perform at the level of an attending surgeon using 3D augmented reality (p = 0.08). All participants had improved times for the ring path task with better resolution (lower resolution 23 ± 11 s vs higher resolution 14 ± 4 s, p = 0.002). 3D augmented reality vision with high resolution decreased time and improved accuracy of more complex tasks, enabling a less experienced robotic surgical bedside assistant to function similar to attending surgeons. These data warrant further study with additional complex tasks and bedside assistants at various levels of training.",

    "abstract": "\n Industrial human-robot collaboration (HRC) aims to combine the human intelligence and robotic capability to achieve the higher productiveness. In industrial HRC, the communication between human and robot is essential to enhance the understanding the intent of each other to make a more fluent collaboration. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that could record the user’s brain activity that can be translated into interaction messages (e.g., control commands) to the outside world, which is able to build a direct and efficient communication channel between human and robot. However, due to lacking of information feedback mechanism, it is challenging for BCI to control robots with high degree of freedom with the limited number of classifiable mental state. To address this problem, this paper proposes a close-loop BCI with contextual visual feedback by an augmented reality (AR) headset. In such BCI, the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns from the multiple voluntary eye blinks are considered as the input and the its online detection algorithm is proposed whose average accuracy can reach 94.31%. Moreover, an AR-enable information feedback interface is designed which enable to achieve an interactive robotic path planning. A case study of an industrial HRC assembly task is also develop which shows that the proposed closed-up BCI could shorten the time of user input in human-robot interaction.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the benefits and challenges of mixed reality (MR) for the exploration of deep-sea environments with remotely operated vehicles. The approach is twofold: virtual reality (VR) let the scientist explore the environment via a visual 3D model, overcoming limitations of local perception. Augmented reality (AR) concepts are designed in order to improve environment perception and interaction. The key to such concepts is the implementation of 3D visual geo-referenced terrain models from the imaging feedback gathered by the vehicle exploring its unknown surroundings. Image processing, underwater vehicle navigation, and user-friendly displays for robotic intervention are addressed in an integrated concept. A broad development programme carried out at the French Institute for Ocean Science, IFREMER, is described and illustrates technical topics and use cases. 3D perception derived from camera vision is shown to enable AR concepts that will significantly improve remote exploration and intervention in unknown natural environments. Cumulative geo-referenced 3D model building is in the process of being taken to reliable functioning in real-world underwater applications, accomplishing a milestone change in the capacity to view and understand the obscure and inaccessible deep-sea world.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe traditional navigation interface was intended only for two-dimensional observation by doctors; thus, this interface does not display the total spatial information for the lesion area. Surgical navigation systems have become essential tools that enable for doctors to accurately and safely perform complex operations. The image navigation interface is separated from the operating area, and the doctor needs to switch the field of vision between the screen and the patient’s lesion area. In this paper, augmented reality (AR) technology was applied to spinal surgery to provide more intuitive information to surgeons. The accuracy of virtual and real registration was improved via research on AR technology. During the operation, the doctor could observe the AR image and the true shape of the internal spine through the skin.MethodsTo improve the accuracy of virtual and real registration, a virtual and real registration technique based on an improved identification method and robot-assisted method was proposed. The experimental method was optimized by using the improved identification method. X-ray images were used to verify the effectiveness of the puncture performed by the robot.ResultsThe final experimental results show that the average accuracy of the virtual and real registration based on the general identification method was 9.73 ± 0.46 mm (range 8.90–10.23 mm). The average accuracy of the virtual and real registration based on the improved identification method was 3.54 ± 0.13 mm (range 3.36–3.73 mm). Compared with the virtual and real registration based on the general identification method, the accuracy was improved by approximately 65%. The highest accuracy of the virtual and real registration based on the robot-assisted method was 2.39 mm. The accuracy was improved by approximately 28.5% based on the improved identification method.ConclusionThe experimental results show that the two optimized methods are highly very effective. The proposed AR navigation system has high accuracy and stability. This system may have value in future spinal surgeries.",

    "abstract": "Purpose  A robotic intraoperative laser guidance system with hybrid optic-magnetic tracking for skull base surgery is presented. It provides in situ augmented reality guidance for microscopic interventions at the lateral skull base with minimal mental and workload overhead on surgeons working without a monitor and dedicated pointing tools. Methods  Three components were developed: a registration tool (Rhinospider), a hybrid magneto-optic-tracked robotic feedback control scheme and a modified robotic end-effector. Rhinospider optimizes registration of patient and preoperative CT data by excluding user errors in fiducial localization with magnetic tracking. The hybrid controller uses an integrated microscope HD camera for robotic control with a guidance beam shining on a dual plate setup avoiding magnetic field distortions. A robotic needle insertion platform (iSYS Medizintechnik GmbH, Austria) was modified to position a laser beam with high precision in a surgical scene compatible to microscopic surgery. Results  System accuracy was evaluated quantitatively at various target positions on a phantom. The accuracy found is 1.2 mm ± 0.5 mm. Errors are primarily due to magnetic tracking. This application accuracy seems suitable for most surgical procedures in the lateral skull base. The system was evaluated quantitatively during a mastoidectomy of an anatomic head specimen and was judged useful by the surgeon. Conclusion  A hybrid robotic laser guidance system with direct visual feedback is proposed for navigated drilling and intraoperative structure localization. The system provides visual cues directly on/in the patient anatomy, reducing the standard limitations of AR visualizations like depth perception. The custom- built end-effector for the iSYS robot is transparent to using surgical microscopes and compatible with magnetic tracking. The cadaver experiment showed that guidance was accurate and that the end-effector is unobtrusive. This laser guidance has potential to aid the surgeon in finding the optimal mastoidectomy trajectory in more difficult interventions.",

    "abstract": "In room-clearing tasks, SWAT team members suffer from a lack of initial environmental information: knowledge about what is in a room and what relevance or threat level it represents for mission parameters. Normally this gap in situation awareness is rectified only upon room entry, forcing SWAT team members to rely on quick responses and near-instinctual reactions. This can lead to dangerously escalating situations or important missed information which, in turn, can increase the likelihood of injury and even mortality. Thus, we present an x-ray vision system for the dynamic scanning and display of room content, using a robotic platform to mitigate operator risk. This system maps a room using a robot-equipped stereo depth camera and, using an augmented reality (AR) system, presents the resulting geographic information according to the perspective of each officer. This intervention has the potential to notably lower risk and increase officer situation awareness, all while team members are in the relative safety of cover. With these potential stakes, it is important to test the viability of this system natively and in an operational SWAT team context.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, smart warehouses mostly use Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) controlled through magnetic or painted paths. This approach is suitable for “static slotting” warehouses, and for places where humans do not cross paths with mobile robots. Therefore, fixed-path AGVs are not an optimal solution for dynamic slotting “chaotic storage” warehouses, where picking and delivery paths are often changing. Hence, it is important to create an environment where AGVs have planned their path, and storekeepers can see their paths, and mark restricted areas by virtual means if needed, for these mobile robots and humans to move and stand safely around a smart warehouse. In this paper, we have proposed an Augmented Reality (AR) environment for storekeepers, where they can see an AGV planned path, and they can add virtual obstacles and walls to the mobile robots’ cyber-physical navigation view. These virtual obstacles and walls can be used to determine restricted areas for mobile robots, which can be seen for example as safe areas for humans’ and/or robots’ stationary work. Finally, we introduce the system architecture supporting the proposed AR environment for humans-mobile robots safe and productive interaction.",

In this system, augmented reality models used to represent monitor are superimposed on the dual point of view, which enables users to control each part of actuated monitor intuitively with interaction of augmented reality models on screen.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMandibular angle split osteotomy (MASO) is a procedure widely used for prominent mandibular angles. However, conventional mandibular plastic surgery is invasive and high risk. It may induce postoperative neurosensory disturbance of the inferior alveolar nerve, fractures and infection due to the complexity of the anatomical structure and the narrow surgical field of view. The success rate of MASO surgery usually depends on the clinical experience and skills of the surgeon. To evaluate the performance of inexperienced plastic surgeons conducting this surgery, a self-developed and constructed robot system based on augmented reality is used. This robot system provides for sufficient accuracy and safety within the clinical environment. To evaluate the accuracy and safety of MASO surgery, an animal study using this robot was performed in the clinical room, and the results were then evaluated. Four osteotomy planes were successfully performed on two dogs; that is, twenty tunnels (each dog drilled on bilaterally) were drilled in the dogs’ mandible bones. Errors at entrance and target points were 1.04 ± 0.19 and 1.22 ± 0.24 mm, respectively. The angular error between the planned and drilled tunnels was 6.69° ± 1.05°. None of the dogs experienced severe complications. Therefore, this technique can be regarded as a useful approach for training inexperienced plastic surgeons on the various aspects of plastic surgery.No Level Assigned This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

    "abstract": "PurposeUsing existing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) electrode implantation surgical robot systems, it is difficult to intuitively validate registration accuracy and display the electrode entry points (EPs) and the anatomical structure around the electrode trajectories in the patient space to the surgeon. This paper proposes a prototype system that can realize video see-through augmented reality (VAR) and spatial augmented reality (SAR) for SEEG implantation. The system helps the surgeon quickly and intuitively confirm the registration accuracy, locate EPs and visualize the internal anatomical structure in the image space and patient space.MethodsWe designed and developed a projector-camera system (PCS) attached to the distal flange of a robot arm. First, system calibration is performed. Second, the PCS is used to obtain the point clouds of the surface of the patient’s head, which are utilized for patient-to-image registration. Finally, VAR is produced by merging the real-time video of the patient and the preoperative three-dimensional (3D) operational planning model. In addition, SAR is implemented by projecting the planning electrode trajectories and local anatomical structure onto the patient’s scalp.ResultsThe error of registration, the electrode EPs and the target points are evaluated on a phantom. The fiducial registration error is $$0.25 \\pm 0.23$$0.25±0.23 mm (max 1.22 mm), and the target registration error is $$0.62\\pm 0.28$$0.62±0.28 mm (max 1.18 mm). The projection overlay error is $$0.75\\pm 0.52$$0.75±0.52 mm, and the TP error after the pre-warped projection is $$0.82\\pm 0.23$$0.82±0.23 mm. The TP error caused by a surgeon’s viewpoint deviation is also evaluated.ConclusionThe presented system can help surgeons quickly verify registration accuracy during SEEG procedures and can provide accurate EP locations and internal structural information to the surgeon. With more intuitive surgical information, the surgeon may have more confidence and be able to perform surgeries with better outcomes.",

In this system, a three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) model generated from each patient’s computed tomography image is overlaid on the endoscopic image, and we control it manually to navigate the vascular structure and tumor location in real time. The position and orientation of the 3DCG model is calculated from the optical flow of the endoscopic camera images, which enables the model to move semi-automatically. We conducted 20 navigations for RALPN from April 2014 to December 2016. Our support system worked appropriately and was helpful to localize the tumor and determine the resection line.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is a standard of care for small kidney cancer tumours. A successful LPN is the complete excision of the kidney tumour while preserving as much of the non-cancerous kidney as possible. This is a challenging procedure because the surgeon has a limited field of view and reduced or no haptic feedback while performing delicate excisions as fast as possible. This work introduces and evaluates a novel surgical navigation marker called the Dynamic Augmented Reality Tracker (DART). The DART is used in a novel intra-operative augmented reality ultrasound navigation system (ARUNS) for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery to overcome some of these challenges. The DART is inserted into a kidney and the DART and pick-up laparoscopic ultrasound transducer are tracked during an intra-operative freehand ultrasound scan of the tumour. After ultrasound, the system continues to track the DART and display the segmented 3D tumour and location of surgical instruments relative to the tumour throughout the surgery. The ultrasound point reconstruction root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.9 mm, the RMSE of tracking the da Vinci surgical instruments was 1.5 mm and the total system RMSE, which includes ultrasound imaging and da Vinci kinematic instrument tracking, was 5.1 mm. The system was evaluated by an expert surgeon who used the DART and ARUNS to excise a tumour from a kidney phantom. This work serves as a preliminary evaluation in anticipation of further refinement and validation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "In transoral robotic surgery preoperative image data do not reflect large deformations of the operative workspace from perioperative setup. To address this challenge, in this study we explore image guidance with cone beam computed tomographic angiography to guide the dissection of critical vascular landmarks and resection of base-of-tongue neoplasms with adequate margins for transoral robotic surgery. We identify critical vascular landmarks from perioperative c-arm imaging to augment the stereoscopic view of a da Vinci si robot in addition to incorporating visual feedback from relative tool positions. Experiments resecting base-of-tongue mock tumors were conducted on a series of ex vivo and in vivo animal models comparing the proposed workflow for video augmentation to standard non-augmented practice and alternative, fluoroscopy-based image guidance. Accurate identification of registered augmented critical anatomy during controlled arterial dissection and en bloc mock tumor resection was possible with the augmented reality system. The proposed image-guided robotic system also achieved improved resection ratios of mock tumor margins (1.00) when compared to control scenarios (0.0) and alternative methods of image guidance (0.58). The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed workflow and advantages of cone beam computed tomography image guidance through video augmentation of the primary stereo endoscopy as compared to control and alternative navigation methods.",

The framework also builds a world model representation that serves as ground truth for training and validating algorithms for vision, motion planning and control. We demonstrate the application of the AR-based framework for evaluating the capability of the robot to plan safe paths to goal locations in real outdoor scenarios, while the planning scene dynamically changes, being augmented by virtual objects.",

The reconnaissance robots Orpheus-AC, Orpheus-AC2 and Orpheus-Explorer, made in the Department of Control and Instrumentation (DCI), are then shortly described. Since all the described robotic systems use visual telepresence as the main control technique, visual information from the robots surroundings is essential for the operator. For this reason, the authors make a fusion of data from a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) color camera, and a thermovision camera to provide the operator with data in all visibility conditions, such as complete darkness, fog, smoke, etc.",

    "abstract": "Hyper-redundant robots are highly articulated devices that present numerous technical challenges such as their design, control or remote operation. However, they offer superior kinematic skills than traditional robots for multiple applications. This work proposes an original and custom-made design for a discrete and hyper-redundant manipulator. It is comprised of 7 sections actuated by cables and 14 degrees of freedom. It has been optimized to be very robust, accurate and capable of moving payloads with high dexterity. Furthermore, it has been efficiently controlled from the actuators to high-level strategies based on the management of its shape. However, these highly articulated systems often exhibit complex shapes that frustrate their spatial understanding. Immersive technologies emerge as a good solution to remotely and safely teleoperate the presented robot for an inspection task in a hazardous environment. Experimental results validate the proposed robot design and control strategies. As a result, it is concluded that hyper-redundant robots and immersive technologies should play an important role in the near future of automated and remote applications.",

In this paper we describe our system and its implementation with a mobile robot. In our prototype the human communicates with the mobile robot using natural speech and gestures, for example, by selecting a point in 3D space and saying “go here” or “go behind that”. The robot responds using speech so the human is able to understand its intentions and beliefs. Augmented Reality (AR) technology is used to facilitate natural use of gestures and provide a common 3D spatial reference for both the robot and human, thus providing a means for grounding of communication and maintaining spatial awareness. This paper first discusses related work then gives a brief overview of AR and its capabilities. The architectural design we have developed is outlined and then a case study is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The field of Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) tutoring has extensively explored both subjective and objective usability metrics for seated tablet-based human-robot interactions. As SAR tutoring introduces kinesthetic mixed reality environments where students can move around and physically manipulate virtual objects, usability metrics for such interactions need to be re-evaluated. This paper applies standard usability metrics from seated 2D interactions to a kinesthetic mixed reality environment and validates those metrics with post-interaction survey data. Using data from a pilot study (n = 9) conducted with a mixed reality SAR tutor, three commonly-used metrics of usability for seated 2D tutoring interfaces were collected: performance, manipulation time, and gaze. The strength of each usability metric was compared to subjective survey-based scores measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results show that usability scores were correlated with the gaze metric but not with the manipulation time or performance metrics.

    "abstract": "Developing complex robotic systems requires expensive and time-consuming verification and testing which, especially in a case of multi-robot unmanned aerial systems (UASs), aggregates risk of hardware failures and may pose legal issues in experiments where operating more than one unmanned aircraft simultaneously is required. Thus, it is highly favorable to find and resolve most of the eventual design flaws and system bugs in a simulation, where their impacts are significantly lower. On the other hand, as the system development process approaches the final stages, the fidelity of the simulation needs to rise. However, since some phenomena that can significantly influence the system behavior are difficult to be modeled precisely, a partial embodiment of the simulation in the physical world is necessary. In this paper, we present a method for incremental development of complex unmanned aerial systems with the help of mixed reality simulations. The presented methodology is accompanied with a cost analysis to further show its benefits. The generality and versatility of the method is demonstrated in three practical use cases of various aviation systems development: (i) an unmanned system consisting of heterogeneous team of autonomous unmanned aircraft; (ii) a system for verification of collision avoidance methods among fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles; and (iii) a system for planning collision-free paths for light-sport aircraft.",

By using mixed reality, the users can see the robot and the videos within the same field of view. The users therefore can review their own driving in an environment similar to a lecture at a driving school. Comparative experiments were performed with three groups; a group in which mixed reality was used to display driving situations (proposed system), a group in which tablet terminals were used, and a group in which only a robot was used (no video). The results show that using the proposed system for driving review may increase attachment to the robot.",

For human-robot interaction to run smoothly and naturally, a robot should be equipped with the ability to robustly disambiguate referring expressions. In this work, we propose a model that can disambiguate multimodal fetching requests using modalities such as head movements, hand gestures, and speech. We analysed the acquired data from mixed reality experiments and formulated a hypothesis that modelling temporal dependencies of events in these three modalities increases the model's predictive power. We evaluated our model on a Bayesian framework to interpret referring expressions with and without exploiting a temporal prior.",

However, the reliability of the simulation results and its usefulness in solving practical problems remain to be validated. This paper presents an evaluation of an MR simulator by examining its use for the development of a robotic screw remover system. Quantitative evaluation compares the robot's trajectories produced in our MR simulation with those from a real world experiment, yielding results that indicate the MR simulation reliably represents the real world. A user study was conducted and the results demonstrate that the MR simulator gives users a stronger confidence of accurate results in comparison to a virtual simulator.",

The proposed interface is equipped with full capabilities in order to replace the classical teach pendant of the robot for carrying out teleoperation tasks. The proposed interface is based on an augmented reality headset for projecting computer-generated graphics onto the real environment and a gamepad to interact with the computer-generated graphics and provide robot commands. In order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method, several usability tests were conducted using a 6R industrial robot manipulator in order to compare the proposed interface and the conventional teach pendant interface for teleoperation tasks. In particular, the results of these usability tests show that the proposed approach is more intuitive, ergonomic, and easy to use. Furthermore, the comparison results also show that the proposed method clearly improves the velocity of the teleoperation task, regardless of the user’s previous experience in robotics and augmented reality technology.",

Design and evaluation of the HRC assembly workstation considering the human factor is very important. In order to evaluate the transformational construction scenario of a manual assembly workstation to a HRC workstation fast and safely, a HRC assembly simulation system is constructed which is based on Augmented Reality (AR) with human-in-loop interaction. It enables a real operator to interact with virtual robot in a real scene, and the assembly steps of real workers can be restored and mapped to a virtual human model for further ergonomic analysis. Kinect and LeapMotion are used as the sensors for human-robot interaction decision and feedback. An automobile gearbox assembly is taken as an example for different assembly task verification, operators’ data are collected and analyzed by RULA scores and NASA-TLX questionnaires. The result shows that the simulation system can be used for the human factor evaluation of different HRC task configuration schemes.",

    "abstract": "Accurately detecting changes in one’s environment is an important ability for many application domains, but can be challenging for humans. Autonomous robots can easily be made to autonomously detect metric changes in the environment, but unlike humans, understanding context can be challenging for robots. We present a novel system that uses an autonomous robot performing point cloud-based change detection to facilitate information-gathering tasks and provides enhanced situational awareness. The robotic system communicates detected changes via augmented reality to a human teammate for evaluation. We present results from a fielded system using two differently-equipped robots to examine implementation questions of point cloud density and its effect on visualization of changes. Our results show that there are trade-offs between implementations that we believe will be constructive towards similar systems in the future.",

    "abstract": "For teams of humans and mobile robots to work together, several challenges must be overcome, including understanding each others’ position, merging map information, sharing recognition of salient features of the environment, and establishing contextually-grounded communication. These challenges are further compounded for teams operating in field environments, which are unconstrained, uninstrumented, and unknown. While most modern studies that use augmented reality (AR) in human-robot teaming side-step these challenges by focusing on problems addressable in instrumented environments, we argue that current AR technology combined with novel approaches can enable successful teaming in such challenging, real-world settings. To support this, we present a set of prototypes that combine AR with an intelligent, autonomous robot to enable better human-robot teaming in field environments.",

    "abstract": "Amid the increasing interest in applying augmented reality (AR) in educational settings, this study explores the design and enactment of an AR-infused robot system to enhance children’s satisfaction and sensory engagement with dramatic play activities. In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children’s perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5–6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children’s perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the older-aged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies. Implications of the current study and future research directions are also discussed.",

This paper presents a novel augmented reality (AR) based interface for interactive robot path and end-effector (EE) orientation planning. A number of human-virtual robot interaction methods have been formulated and implemented with respect to the various types of robotic operations needed in different applications. A Euclidean distance-based method is developed to assist the users in the modification of the waypoints so as to update the planned paths and/or orientation profiles within the proposed AR environment. The virtual cues augmented in the real environment can support and enhance human-virtual robot interaction at different stages of the robot tasks planning process. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the successful implementation of the proposed AR-based interface in planning robot pick-and-place tasks and path following tasks.",

The targeted applications are those where the end-effector is constrained to follow a visible path, which position and model are unknown, at suitable inclination angles with respect to the path. The proposed approach enables the users to create a list of control points interactively on a parameterized curve model, define the orientation of the end-effector associated with each control point, and generate a ruled surface representing the path to be planned. An approximated time-optimal trajectory, which is a determined subject to robot actuators and joint velocity constraints using convex optimization techniques, is implemented to simulate a virtual robot, allowing the users to visually evaluate the trajectory planning process. A case study is presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "In automotive industry, industrial robots are widely used in production lines for many tasks such as welding, painting or assembly. Their use requires, from users, both a good manipulation and robot control. Recently, new tools have been developed to realize fast and accurate trajectories in many production sectors by using the real prototype of vehicle or a generalized design within a virtual simulation platform. However, many issues could be considered in these cases: the delay between the design of the vehicle and its production is often important, moreover, the virtual modeling presents a non realistic aspect of the real robot and vehicle, so this factor could introduce localization inacurracies in performing trajectories. Our work is registered as a part of TRI project (Teleteaching Industrial Robots) which aims to realize a demonstrator showing the interaction of industrial robots with virtual components and allowing to train users to perform successfully their tasks on a virtual representation of a production entity.",

    "abstract": "In the process of developing an endoscopic surgical robot system that adapts to NOTES (Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery) and SPS (Single port surgery), by making the tip a soft tubular structure and adding an augmented reality function to the system, we were able to improve the general function of the surgical robot system. First, we added a haptic sense function to avoid breaking the soft tissue and to avoid the danger of cutting it. These occur due to the small size of the touching surface between the tip of the robot arm and the soft tissue. We were able to conduct operation by feeding back to the surgeon the force applied to the soft tissue by detecting the haptic sense of the small forceps at the tip through measuring the tension variation at the base of the wire that drives the robot arm. We also mounted various numbers of augmented reality function such as grasping the exact location of the surgical robot inside the human body and information on how the robot is reaching the location of surgery. As a result, we were able to build a system that can conduct safe surgery with the system's two main characteristics - the smallness and the high degree of freedom to move.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the development of a collaborative system enabling to tele-operate groups of robots. The general aim is to allow a group of tele-operators to share the control of robots. This system enables the joint team of operators and robots to achieve complex tasks such as inspecting an area or exploring unknown parts of an unknown environment. \n \nThanks to virtual and augmented reality techniques, a Virtual and Augmented Collaborative Environment (VACE) is built. This last supports a N*M*K scheme: N 1;N tele-operators control M 1;M robots at K 1;K abstraction levels. Indeed, our VACE allows to N people to control any robot at different abstraction's levels (from individual actuator's control K = 1 to final status specification K = 3). On the other hand, the VACE enables to build synthetic representations of the robots and their world. Robots may appear to tele-operators as individuals or reduced to a single virtual entity. \n \nWe present in this paper an overview of this system and an application, namely a museum visit. We show how visitors can control robots and improve their immersion using a head-tracking system combined with a VR helmet to control the active vision systems on the remote mobile robots. We also introduce the ability to control the remote robots configuration, at a group level. We finally show how Augmented and Virtual Reality add-ons are included to ease the execution of remote tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a human-machine interface with augmented reality for the network based mobile robot. Generally, we can take some meaningful information from human's motion such as movement of head or fingers. So, it is very useful to take these motions as input for systems. We synchronize head motion of human being and the camera motion of the mobile robot using visual information. So user of the mobile robot can monitor environment of the mobile robot as eyesight of mobile robot. Then we use gesture recognition for control the mobile robot. In the implemented framework, the user can monitor what happens in environment as eyesight of mobile robot and control the mobile robot easily and intuitively by using gesture.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated scheme based on a mixed reality (MR) and haptic feedback approach for intuitive and immersive teleoperation of robotic welding systems. By incorporating MR technology, the user is fully immersed in a virtual operating space augmented by real-time visual feedback from the robot working space. The proposed robotic tele-welding system features imitative motion mapping from the user’s hand movements to the welding robot motions, and it enables the spatial velocity-based control of the robot tool center point (TCP). The proposed mixed reality virtual fixture (MRVF) integration approach implements hybrid haptic constraints to guide the operator’s hand movements following the conical guidance to effectively align the welding torch for welding and constrain the welding operation within a collision-free area. Onsite welding and tele-welding experiments identify the operational differences between professional and unskilled welders and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MRVF tele-welding framework for novice welders. The MRVF-integrated visual/haptic tele-welding scheme reduced the torch alignment times by 56% and 60% compared to the MRnoVF and baseline cases, with minimized cognitive workload and optimal usability. The MRVF scheme effectively stabilized welders’ hand movements and eliminated undesirable collisions while generating smooth welds.",

The introduction of Tablet-based augmented reality (AR) into surgical robots may assist surgeons with overcoming these problems. In this paper, we proposed and developed a robot-assisted surgical system with interactive surgical guidance using tablet-based AR with a Kinect sensor for three-dimensional (3D) localization of patient anatomical structures and intraoperative 3D surgical tool navigation. Depth data acquired from the Kinect sensor was visualized in cone-shaped layers for 3D AR-assisted navigation. Virtual visual cues generated by the tablet were overlaid on the images of the surgical field for spatial reference. We evaluated the proposed system and the experimental results showed that the tablet-based visual guidance system could assist surgeons in locating internal organs, with errors between 1.74 and 2.96 mm. We also demonstrated that the system was able to provide mobile augmented guidance and interaction for surgical tool navigation.",

We use virtual collision detection based on time-of-flight sensor data, combined with augmented reality and audio feedback, allowing the operators to navigate a virtual menu by “hover and hold” gestures. When incorporated with virtual safety barriers, the collision detection also functions as a safety feature, slowing or stopping the robot if a barrier is breached. Additionally, a user focus recognition module monitors the awareness, enabling the interaction only when intended. Early case studies show that these features present good use-cases for inspection tasks and operation in difficult environments, where contactless operation is needed.",

    "abstract": "Simple Summary Robotic surgery has gained much attention in liver resection for its potential to increase surgical dexterity in a minimally invasive scenario. Different series are reported in the literature with promising results, although strong evidence is lacking. In addition, the robotic system presents the advantage of creating a hybrid interface in which pre- and intra-operative imaging tools could be exploited alone or together in order to guide surgical resection. These technologies have been developed with the aim of increasing surgical safety and improving oncological results. However, some drawbacks are still present, and the literature lacks data given the relatively recent distribution of the robotic platform and of some of these technologies. Abstract Artificial intelligence makes surgical resection easier and safer, and, at the same time, can improve oncological results. The robotic system fits perfectly with these more or less diffused technologies, and it seems that this benefit is mutual. In liver surgery, robotic systems help surgeons to localize tumors and improve surgical results with well-defined preoperative planning or increased intraoperative detection. Furthermore, they can balance the absence of tactile feedback and help recognize intrahepatic biliary or vascular structures during parenchymal transection. Some of these systems are well known and are already widely diffused in open and laparoscopic hepatectomies, such as indocyanine green fluorescence or ultrasound-guided resections, whereas other tools, such as Augmented Reality, are far from being standardized because of the high complexity and elevated costs. In this paper, we review all the experiences in the literature on the use of artificial intelligence systems in robotic liver resections, describing all their practical applications and their weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "The Kilobot is a popular platform for swarm robotics research due to its low cost and ease of manufacturing. Despite this, the effort to bootstrap the design of new behaviours and the time necessary to develop and debug new behaviours is considerable. To make this process less burdensome, high-performing and flexible simulation tools are important. In this paper, we present a plugin for the ARGoS simulator designed to simplify and accelerate experimentation with Kilobots. First, the plugin supports cross-compiling against the real robot platform, removing the need to translate algorithms across different languages. Second, it is highly configurable to match the real robot behaviour. Third, it is fast and allows running simulations with several hundreds of Kilobots in a fraction of real time. We present the design choices that drove our work and report on experiments with physical robots performed to validate simulated behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Planning, control, perception, and learning are current research challenges in multirobot systems. The transition dynamics of the robots may be unknown or stochastic, making it difficult to select the best action each robot must take at a given time. The observation model, a function of the robots' sensor systems, may be noisy or partial, meaning that deterministic knowledge of the team's state is often impossible to attain. Moreover, the actions each robot can take may have an associated success rate and/or a probabilistic completion time. Robots designed for real-world applications require careful consideration of such sources of uncertainty, regardless of the control scheme or planning or learning algorithms used for a specific problem. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of planning algorithms can be challenging due to the latent variables they often operate on. When performance testing such algorithms on hardware, the simultaneous use of the debugging and visualization tools available on a workstation can be difficult. This transition from experimentation to implementation becomes especially challenging when the experiments need to replicate some feature of the software tool set in hardware, such as simulation of visually complex environments. This article details a robotics prototyping platform, called measurable augmented reality for prototyping cyberphysical systems (MAR-CPS), that directly addresses this problem, allowing for the real-time visualization of latent state information to aid hardware prototyping and performance testing of algorithms.",

However, working through a CAD system removes users from the workpiece. Recent interactive fabrication tools reintroduce this directness, but at the expense of precision. In this paper, we introduce constructable, an interactive drafting table that produces precise physical output in every step. Users interact by drafting directly on the workpiece using a hand-held laser pointer. The system tracks the pointer, beautifies its path, and implements its effect by cutting the workpiece using a fast high-powered laser cutter. Constructable achieves precision through tool-specific constraints, user-defined sketch lines, and by using the laser cutter itself for all visual feedback, rather than using a screen or projection. We demonstrate how constructable allows creating simple but functional devices, including a simple gearbox, that cannot be created with traditional interactive fabrication tools.",

This paper explores using tablets to render mixed-reality visual environments that support human-robot collaboration for object manipulation. A mobile interface is created on a tablet by integrating real-time vision, 3D graphics, touchscreen interaction, and wireless communication. This mobile interface augments a live video of physical objects in a robot's workspace with corresponding virtual objects that can be manipulated by a user to intuitively command the robot to manipulate the physical objects. By generating the mixed-reality environment on an exocentric view provided by the tablet camera, the interface establishes a common frame of reference for the user and the robot to effectively communicate spatial information for object manipulation. After addressing challenges due to limitations in mobile sensing and computation, the interface is evaluated with participants to examine the performance and user experience with the suggested approach.",

This article presents the research, development, and testing of an infrastructure, called Robot Arena, for the development of innovative games using the spatial augmented reality and new interfaces that this technology brings. Based on horizontal interfaces with elements of hardware and software, Robot ARena has a flexible architecture that enables different ways of interaction and visualization. Another aspect planned for this project is the control and communication of robots, which can be used as avatars in games. A Robot ARena prototype was implemented, tested, and used in the development of two game prototypes, FootBot ARena and TanSpace, which bring new challenges to the infrastructure, such as exploration of the influence of virtual objects on real objects and the application of tangible interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Robot Gardens are an augmented reality concept allowing a human user to design a biohybrid, plant-robot system. Plants growing from deliberately placed seeds are directed by robotic units that the user can position, configure and activate. For example, the robotic units may serve as physical shields or frames but they may also guide the plants' growth through emission of light. The biohybrid system evolves over time to redefine architectural spaces. This gives rise to the particular challenge of designing a biohybrid system before its actual implementation and potentially long before its developmental processes unfold. Here, an augmented reality interface featuring according simulation models of plants and robotic units allows one to explore the design space a priori. In this work, we present our first functional augmented reality prototype to design biohybrid systems. We provide details about its workings and elaborate on first empirical studies on its usability.",

    "abstract": "Today's industrial robots require that human operators teach motions in advance. However, conventional methods for robot programming need deep knowledge and skills about robots or great effort for inputting information of working environment into computers. Therefore, a robot programming method in which everyone can easily teach robots “good” motions is demanded. For this purpose, our group proposed a robot programming method that uses manual volume sweeping by operators and automatic motion planning together to generate motion plans with short cycle times. Because a swept volume is the space through which the robot has passed without collision, it is movable space of the robot that can be used in motion planning. In this paper, we proposed using augmented reality in this programming method. We constructed a system in which operators can perceive obtained swept volumes and generated paths intuitively through augmented reality. Teaching experiments showed that non-skilled operators can make a robot move in shorter time than teaching/playback by direct teaching.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency (RF) ablation delivered through interventional procedure is a good alternative to hepatic resection or liver transplant for treatment of liver tumor. However, inefficient RF needle navigation and limited thermal ablation region challenge surgeons' manipulations. This paper presents robot-assisted RF ablation system for liver tumor treatment with interactive planning and mixed reality guidance. Interactive planning involves ablation model planning and surgeon's supervisory feedback via projector-based augmented reality (AR). The preoperatively defined surgical planning data is visualized directly on the patient body through the AR display, supplying information of insertion points, ablation points as well as preplanned trajectories, before execution by robot. The needle's spatial insertion is intraoperatively navigated by stereoscopic tracking and simulated in a model based virtual environment comprising anatomic and RF needle models. The robotic execution benefited from improved accuracy on needle's tip tracking and model based simulation. Ex vivo model and in vivo animal studies were conducted to validate and assess the performance of proposed mechanism. This solution is promising in overcoming current technological limitations and practical constraints of precise transcutaneous ablation therapy.",

    "abstract": "The planning and evaluation of robotics solutions in logistic environments is a time consuming process. It usually requires to plan on paper or with 2D CAD software the setup and flow of the parts in a line, with the need to buy and set up expensive equipment in order to test and validate the planned solution. Augmented Reality (AR) is a promising technology for these applications. The required equipment and parts can be simulated in order to evaluate the system beforehand, computing the resulting performance information automatically. The simulated hardware can be superimposed at the desired position in the real scenario, giving the user a more precise information on how the components in the setup will behave. In this work we propose an AR system to plan and configure a line consisting of a robot and a conveyor belt. The proposed system architecture allows to adapt the behavior of the existing hardware components accordingly to the changes introduced in the simulation. The performances of the picking task are computed by the system and visualized to the user, as well as the simulated objects. A GUI allows the worker to change and adjust the speed of the robotics components and the position and flow of the parts. An additional robot can be placed and visualized in order to evaluate the improvements in the line performance deploying additional equipment.",

    "abstract": "One of the problems in developing a humanoid robot is caused by the fact that intermediate results, such as what the robot perceives the environment, and how it plans its moving path are hard to be observed online in the physical environment. What developers can see is only the behavior. Therefore, they usually investigate logged data afterwards, to analyze how well each component worked, or which component was wrong in the total system. In this paper, we present a novel environment for robot development, in which intermediate results of the system are overlaid on physical space using mixed reality technology. Real-time observation enables the developers to see intuitively, in what situation the specific intermediate results are generated, and to understand how results of a component affected the total system. This feature makes the development efficient and precise. This environment also gives a human-robot interface that shows the robot internal state intuitively, not only in development, but also in operation.",

    "abstract": "Robots are an important part of social production now, and their control methods have become an important research topic. There is a greater need for remote control and richer ways of interacting. In this paper, virtual reality and the surface electromyography(sEMG) signals are combined with the control of the omnidirectional mobile robot(OMR), and the programs of two devices, the HoloLens and the MYO armband, are respectively programmed and developed, so that they can work together to control the OMR. The basic control method is that HoloLens wearer controls the movement direction of the OMR through gesture or gaze. MYO armband wearer generate different sEMG signals through different gesture to control the velocity of the OMR. When two devices are used together, they can control all the motion of the OMR.",

    "abstract": "In the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems and the delivery of goods, new technology approaches need to be developed in order to cope with certain challenges that last mile delivery entails, such as navigation in an urban environment. Autonomous delivery robots can help overcome these challenges. We propose a method for performing mixed reality (MR) simulation with ROS-based robots using Unity, which synchronizes the real and virtual environment, and simultaneously uses the sensor information of the real robots to locate themselves and project them into the virtual environment, so that they can use their virtual doppelganger to perceive the virtual world. Using this method, real and virtual robots can perceive each other and the environment in which the other party is located, thereby enabling the exchange of information between virtual and real objects. Through this approach a more realistic and reliable simulation can be obtained. Results of the demonstrated use-cases verified the feasibility and efficiency as well as the stability of implementing MR using Unity for Robot Operating System (ROS)-based robots.",

The robotic arm has been used to configure the MR environment automatically while guaranteeing the correct merging between real and virtual objects and the repeatability of the testing sessions. The user's presence, near an industrial robot, arises some issues on the safety and on the human-robot interaction that we have been addressed in order to improve the performing of the ergonomic test.

    "abstract": "An instrument based on the integration of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and Augmented Reality (AR) is proposed for robotic autism rehabilitation. Flickering stimuli at fixed frequencies appear on the display of Augmented Reality (AR) glasses. When the user focuses on one of the stimuli a Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) occurs on his occipital region. A single-channel electroencephalographic Brain Computer Interface detects the elicited SSVEP and sends the corresponding commands to a mobile robot. The device’s high wearability (single channel and dry electrodes), and the trainingless usability are fundamental for the acceptance by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children. Effectively controlling the movements of a robot through a new channel enhances rehabilitation engagement and effectiveness. A case study at an accredited rehabilitation center on 10 healthy adult subjects highlighted an average accuracy higher than 83%. Preliminary further tests at the Department of Translational Medical Sciences of University of Naples Federico II on 3 ASD patients between 8 and 10 years old provided positive feedback on device acceptance and attentional performance.",

    "abstract": "The appearance of video games in modern society introduced a number of modifications in the recreational and socialization habits of both youths and adults. In particular, various studies have associated the excessive use of this media with health and social problems, being the “classical” video game often a sedentary and solitary activity. The purpose of this work is to propose a possible way to deal with the above issues, which consists in exploiting a platform for robotic gaming based on consumer hardware that is being developed with the aim to reintroduce the physical and social dimensions in digital games. The proposed solution encompasses a floor-projected Mixed Reality (MR) environment, an autonomous toy robot and a set of tangible interfaces created using proximity beacons, which are combined in a robotic game concept named RobotQuest that is meant to show how to favor an engaging room-scale interaction between players and real/virtual game elements.",

    "abstract": "This video demonstrates a mixed reality (MR) environment which is constructed for development of autonomous behaviors of robots. Many kinds of functions are required to be integrated for realizing an autonomous behavior. For example, autonomous navigation of humanoid robots needs functions, such as, recognition of environment, localization and mapping, path planning, gait planning, dynamically stable biped walking pattern generation, and sensor feedback stabilization of walking. Technologies to realize each function are well investigated by many research works. However, another effort is required for constructing an autonomous behavior by integrating those functions. We demonstrate a MR environment in which internal status of a robot, such as, sensor status, recognition results, planning results, and motion control parameters, can be projected to the environment and its body. We can understand intuitively how each function works as a part of total system in the real environment by using the proposed system, and it helps solving the integration problems. The overview of the system, projection of each internal status, and the application to an autonomous locomotion experiment are presented in the video clip.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, production systems and warehouses still lack human-robot collaboration. Often due to safety issues robots are kept behind safety fences and the overall system is shutdown once a human enters. This paper is based on a new concept to overcome these issues. It consists of a safety concept which ensures a more efficient human-robot collaboration. The human worker can be localized via a safety vest which he/she wears and the nearby robots are also aware of this information. We propose a more efficient and safe overall system by using an Augmented Reality device which offers a simple interface between humans and robots and a Heterogeneous Fleet Management System which plans and provides collision-free paths for humans and robots and ensures that the resulting environment is safe for both robots and humans.",

    "abstract": "The presented spatial programming system provides an assistance system for online programming of industrial robots. A handheld device and a motion tracking system establish the basis for a modular 3D programming approach corresponding to different phases of robot programming: definition, evaluation and adaption. Static and dynamic gestures enable the program definition of poses, trajectories and tasks. The spatial evaluation is done using an Augmented Reality application on a handheld device. Therefore, the programmer is able to move freely within the robot cell and define the program spatially through gestures. The camera image of the handheld is simultaneously enhanced by virtual objects representing the robot program. Based on 3D motion tracking of human movements and a mobile Augmented Reality application, we introduce a novel kind of interaction for the adaption of robot programs. The programmer is enabled to interact with virtual program components through bare-hand gestures. Such sample forms of interaction include translation and rotation applicable to poses, trajectories or tasks representations. Finally, the program is adapted according to the gestural changes and can be transferred from the handheld device directly to the robot controler.",

    "abstract": "Training in the use of robot-assisted surgery systems is necessary before a surgeon is able to perform procedures using these systems because the setup is very different from manual procedures. In addition, surgery robots are highly expensive to both acquire and maintain --- thereby entailing the need for efficient training. When training with the robot, the communication between the trainer and the trainee is limited, since the trainee often cannot see the trainer. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes an Augmented Reality (AR) system where the trainer is controlling two virtual robotic arms. These arms are virtually superimposed on the video feed to the trainee, and can therefore be used to demonstrate and perform various tasks for the trainee. Furthermore, the trainer is presented with a 3D image through a stereoscopic display. Because of the added depth perception, this enables the trainer to better guide and help the trainee. A prototype has been developed using low-cost materials and the system has been evaluated by surgeons at Aalborg University Hospital. User feedback indicated that a 3D display for the trainer is very useful as it enables the trainer to better monitor the procedure, and thereby enhances the training experience. The virtual overlay was also found to work as a good and illustrative approach for enhanced communication. However, the delay of the prototype made it difficult to use for actual training.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an AR-based robotic system that can plan and execute a trajectory based on a 3D medical model and allow the surgeon to supervise the execution of surgical process. In order to achieve image-guided surgery, a hand-eye calibration procedure is developed by using AprilTag to obtain the transformation between the workspace coordinate and the robot coordinate, and perform the image navigation task of the surgical robot to complete a drilling task. A procedure of robot supervised control is proposed to assign or modify the robot trajectory based on AR visualization and 3D model. A specified AR marker is used to project virtual objects in the AR glasses. We developed a robot registration algorithm to match the AR virtual coordinate system and the workspace coordinate system, and convert the planned trajectory into robot trajectory. Experimental results on the lab-built robotic system show that a user can adjust the position and orientation of the insertion point on a bone model, and transmit the trajectory information to the robot for execution. The proposed visualization-based robot navigation method has the potential to enhance the safety of surgical operation.",

    "abstract": "As service robots are becoming essential to support aging societies, teaching them how to perform general service tasks is still a major challenge preventing their deployment in daily-life environments. In addition, developing an artificial intelligence for general service tasks requires bottom-up, unsupervised approaches to let the robots learn from their own observations and interactions with the users. However, compared to the top-down, supervised approaches such as deep learning where the extent of the learning is directly related to the amount and variety of the pre-existing data provided to the robots, and thus relatively easy to understand from a human perspective, the learning status in bottom-up approaches is by their nature much harder to appreciate and visualize. To address these issues, we propose a teaching system for multimodal object categorization by human-robot interaction through Mixed Reality (MR) visualization. In particular, our proposed system enables a user to monitor and intervene in the robot’s object categorization process based on Multimodal Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MLDA) to solve unexpected results and accelerate the learning. Our contribution is twofold by 1) describing the integration of a service robot, MR interactions, and MLDA object categorization in a unified system, and 2) proposing an MR user interface to teach robots through intuitive visualization and interactions.",

    "abstract": "Although human-multi-robot systems have received increased attention in recent years, current implementations rely on structured environments and utilize specialized, research-grade hardware to operate. This letter presents approaches that leverage the visual and inertial sensing of mobile devices to address the estimation and control challenges of multi-robot systems that function in shared spaces with human operators such that both the mobile device camera and robots can move freely in the environment. It is shown that a subset of robots in the system can be used to maintain a reference frame that facilitates tracking and control of the remaining robots to perform tasks, such as object retrieval, using an operator's mobile device as the only sensing and computational platform in the system. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, experiments are conducted in which a system of mobile robots is commanded to retrieve objects in an environment. Results show that, compared to using the visual data alone, integrating both the visual and inertial data from mobile devices yields improvements in performance, flexibility, and computational efficiency in implementing human-multi-robot systems.",

    "abstract": "Programming and executing robot trajectories is a routine manufacturing procedure. However, current interfaces (i.e., teach pendants) are bulky, unintuitive, and interrupts task flow. Recently, augmented reality (AR) has been used to create alternative solutions. However, input modalities of such systems tend to be limited. By introducing the use of electromyography (EMG), we have created a novel multimodal wearable interface for online trajectory programming and execution. Through the use of EMG, our system aims to bridge the user’s force activation to the robot arm force profile. Our proposed system provides two interaction methods for trajectory execution and force control using 1) arm EMG and 2) arm orientation. We compared these methods with a standard joystick in a user study to test their usability. Results show that proposed methods have increased physical demands but yield equivalent task performance, demonstrating the potential of our proposed interface to provide a wearable alternative solution.",

In fact, human-robot interaction design and the design of user interfaces have very much to gain from MR technologies. Nonetheless, designing the user-robot interaction and processing multimodal feedbacks are very challenging tasks. In this paper we focus in particular on interactions in mixed reality. The main contribution of this paper is the implementation of a control system for an industrial manipulator through the user's interactions with MR content displayed with the Microsoft HoloLens. The system is based on the communication between Unity3D (used to design the user experience) and ROS, therefore extendible to any ROS-compatible robotic hardware.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing health problem in the United States, especially among children. Indicators show that the rate of obesity for children age 12-19 years old has risen from 5% percent to 18% over the last ten years. To deal with the obesity epidemic, a number of technology interventions, including the use of robotics and virtual reality games, have arisen to motivate youth to become physically active. The difficulty though lies in providing a tool for health professionals to embed established clinical health protocols into these technologies. As such, in this paper we present a mixed reality system that translates physical demonstrations of various exercise protocols into movements for a robotic agent. This is accomplished by mapping real-time data from an RGB-D sensor to a robotic exercise coach. Details of the system are discussed and results from evaluation with 20 human subjects are provided.",

This paper explores two different categories of mixed-reality deictic gestures for armless robots: a virtual arrow positioned over a target referent (a non-ego-sensitive allocentric gesture) and a virtual arm positioned over the gesturing robot (an ego-sensitive allocentric gesture). Specifically, we present the results of a within-subjects Mixed Reality HRI experiment (N=23) exploring the trade-offs between these two types of gestures with respect to both objective performance and subjective social perceptions. Our results show a clear trade-off between performance and social perception, with non-ego-sensitive allocentric gestures enabling faster reaction time and higher accuracy, but ego-sensitive gestures enabling higher perceived social presence, anthropomorphism, and likability.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an augmented reality visualization interface to simultaneously present visual and laser sensors information further enhanced by stereoscopic viewing and 3-D graphics. The use of graphic elements is proposed to represent laser measurements that are aligned to video information in 3-D space. This methodology enables an operator to intuitively comprehend scene layout and proximity information and so to respond in an accurate and timely manner. The use of graphic elements to assist teleoperation, sometime discussed in the literature, is here proposed following an innovative approach that aligns virtual and real objects in 3-D space and color them suitably to facilitate comprehension of objects proximity during navigation. This paper is developed based on authors' previous experience on stereoscopic teleoperation. The approach is experimented on a real telerobotic system, where a user operates a mobile robot located several kilometers apart. The result showed simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new intuitive method for robot tool path teaching in Augmented Reality (AR) environment. Conventional industrial robot teaching method is long known to be either tedious or require a highly accurate virtual representation of robot work cell. Our method targets to provide the user with a fast and easy way of programming an industrial robot for useful tasks in a safe environment. In our system, a human robot interaction (HRI) system has been designed by fusing information from a camera and a laser ranger finder. The video images provide visual information to the user to operate the system, whereas the laser range finder captures the Cartesian information of the user intended robot working paths and trajectories. Furthermore, an AR environment has been designed where the virtual tool is superimposed onto the live video. The user simply needs to point and click on the image of the workpiece to generate the tool path. User can also adjust virtual tool orientation and simulate the tool trajectory in the AR environment, thus simplifying the robot teaching task. The proposed system has been tested for robot laser welding application. It is intuitive as no prior knowledge of robotic control is required in order to use our system. Most importantly, the system is safe and the user does not need to be physically close to the robot during path teaching.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robotic systems have evolved to include sensors capable of truthfully describing robot status and operating environment as accurately and reliably as never before. This possibility is challenged by effective sensor data exploitation, because of the cognitive load an operator is exposed to, due to the large amount of data and time-dependency constraints. This paper addresses this challenge in remote-vehicle teleoperation by proposing an intuitive way to present sensor data to users by means of using mixed reality and visual aids within the user interface. We propose a method for organizing information presentation and a set of visual aids to facilitate visual communication of data in teleoperation control panels. The resulting sensor-information presentation appears coherent and intuitive, making it easier for an operator to catch and comprehend information meaning. This increases situational awareness and speeds up decision-making. Our method is implemented on a real mobile robotic system operating outdoor equipped with on-board internal and external sensors, GPS, and a reconstructed 3D graphical model provided by an assistant drone. Experimentation verified feasibility while intuitive and comprehensive visual communication was confirmed through an assessment, which encourages further developments.",

    "abstract": "Developing easy to use, intuitive interfaces is crucial to introduce robotic automation to many small medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to their continuously changing product lines, reprogramming costs exceed installation costs by a large margin. In addition, traditional programming methods for industrial robots is too complex for an inexperienced robot programmer, thus external assistance is often needed. In this paper a new incremental multimodal language, which uses augmented reality (AR) environment, is presented. The proposed language architecture makes it possible to manipulate, pick or place the objects in the scene. This approach shifts the focus of industrial robot programming from coordinate based programming paradigm, to object based programming scheme. This makes it possible for non-experts to program the robot in an intuitive way, without going through rigorous training in robot programming.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in robotic systems that are able to share workspaces and collaborate with humans. Such collaborative scenarios require efficient mechanisms to communicate human requests to a robot, as well as to transmit robot interpretations and intents to humans. Recent advances in augmented reality (AR) technologies have provided an alternative for such communication. Nonetheless, most of the existing work in human-robot interaction with AR devices is still limited to robot motion programming or teleoperation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to command and collaborate with robots. Our approach uses an AR interface that allows a user to specify high-level requests to a robot, to preview, approve or modify the computed robot motions. The proposed approach exploits the robot's decision-making capabilities instead of requiring low-level motion specifications provided by the user. The latter is achieved by using a motion planner that can deal with high-level goals corresponding to regions in the robot configuration space. We present a proof of concept to validate our approach in different test scenarios, and we present a discussion of its applicability in collaborative environments.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robots can be difficult to understand by their developers, let alone by end users. Yet, as they become increasingly integral parts of our societies, the need for affordable easy to use tools to provide transparency grows. The rise of the smartphone and the improvements in mobile computing performance have gradually allowed Augmented Reality (AR) to become more mobile and affordable. In this paper we review relevant robot systems architecture and propose a new software tool to provide robot transparency through the use of AR technology. Our new tool, ABOD3-AR provides real-time graphical visualisation and debugging of a robot’s goals and priorities as a means for both designers and end users to gain a better mental model of the internal state and decision making processes taking place within a robot. We also report on our on-going research programme and planned studies to further understand the effects of transparency to naive users and experts.",

    "abstract": "Robot surgery needs measures for safety and dexterous control of the surgical instrument for wider application, in spite of evident clinical efficacy in diverse surgery areas. Integration of the advanced human machine interface technologies including haptic rendering and augmented reality in surgeon console for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to provide enhanced safety and easier system control has been tried in this study. The surgeon console is composed of various hardware and software modules for endoscope video signal capture, image/vision signal processing, 3D deformable model handling, haptic and graphic rendering, and interface to displays and haptic devices. Intra-operative endoscopic video signal is processed to extract information for the tracking of “Object-Of-Interest (OOI)”s such as anatomic structure that needs cautious handling, bleeding site and the relative position of the surgical instruments, and displayed with overlaid image of 3D-reconstructed preoperative medical imaging data. Parts of the extracted or user-defined OOIs can be transformed into a deformable 3D model and interactively manipulated by the surgeon during the operation for intuitive information utilization. The haptic rendering provides virtual force field experience for the surgeon to have safer handling of the surgical instruments and dexterous execution of surgical task. The surgeon console framework has been implemented on a PC integrated in a laparoscopic surgery robot system under development. The system showed successfully the feasibility of the concept and further development for enhanced usability and graphical contents quality is underway.",

    "abstract": "In the growing field of Robotics, one of the many possible paths to explore is the social aspect that it can influence upon the present society. The combination of the goal-oriented development of robots with the interactivity used in games while employing mixed reality is a promising route to take in regard to designing user-friendly robots and improving problem solving featured in artificial intelligence software. In this paper, we present a competitive team-based game using Pololu's 3Pi robots moving in a projected map, capable of human interaction via game controllers. The game engine was developed utilizing the framework Qt Creator with C++ and OpenCV for the image processing tasks. The technical framework uses the ROS framework for communications that may be, in the future, used to connect different modules. Various parameters of the implementation are tested, such as position tracking errors.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel hands-free interaction method using multimodal gestures such as eye gazing and head gestures and deep learning for human-robot interaction (HRI) in mixed reality (MR) environments. Since human operators hold some objects for conducting tasks, there are many constrained situations where they cannot use their hands for HRI interactions. To provide more effective and intuitive task assistance, the proposed hands-free method supports coarse-to-fine interactions. Eye gazing-based interaction is used for coarse interactions such as searching and previewing of target objects, and head gesture interactions are used for fine interactions such as selection and 3D manipulation. In addition, deep learning-based object detection is applied to estimate the initial positioning of physical objects to be manipulated by the robot. The result of object detection is then combined with 3D spatial mapping in the MR environment for supporting accurate initial object positioning. Furthermore, virtual object-based indirect manipulation is proposed to support more intuitive and efficient control of the robot, compared with traditional direct manipulation (e.g., joint-based and end effector-based manipulations). In particular, a digital twin, the synchronized virtual robot of the real robot, is used to provide a preview and simulation of the real robot to manipulate it more effectively and accurately. Two case studies were conducted to confirm the originality and advantages of the proposed hands-free HRI: (1) performance evaluation of initial object positioning and (2) comparative analysis with traditional direct robot manipulations. The deep learning-based initial positioning reduces much effort for robot manipulation using eye gazing and head gestures. The object-based indirect manipulation also supports more effective HRI than previous direct interaction methods.",

    "abstract": "Occupational rehabilitation is an integral part of the recovery process for workers who have sustained injuries at the workplace. It often requires the injured worker to engage in functional tasks that simulate the workplace environment to help regain their functional capabilities and allow for a return to employment. We present a system comprised of a robotic arm for recreating the physical dynamics of functional tasks and a 3D Augmented Reality (AR) display for immersive visualization of the tasks. While this system can be used to simulate a multitude of occupational tasks, we focus on one specific functional task. Participants perform a virtual version of the task using the robot-AR system, and a physical version of the same task without the system. This study shows the results for two able-bodied users to determine if the robot-AR system produces upper-limb movements similar to the real-life equivalent task. The similarity between relative joint positions, i.e., hand-to-elbow (H2E) and elbow-to-shoulder (E2S) displacements, is evaluated within clusters based on the spatial position of the user’s hand. The H2E displacements for approximately 50% of hand position clusters were consistent between the robot-AR and real-world conditions and approximately 30% for E2S displacements. The similar clusters are distributed across the entire task space however, indicating the robot-AR system has the potential to properly simulate real-world equivalent tasks.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) is often discussed as one of the enabling technologies in Industrie 4.0. In this paper, we describe a practical application, where Augmented Reality glasses are used not only for assembly assistance, but also as a means of communication to enable the orchestration of a hybrid team consisting of a human worker and two mobile robotic systems. The task of the hybrid team is to rivet so-called stringers onto an aircraft hull. While the two robots do the physically demanding, unergonomic and possibly hazardous tasks (squeezing and sealing rivets), the human takes over those responsibilities that need experience, multi-sensory sensitiveness and specialist knowledge. We describe the working scenario, the overall architecture and give design and implementation details on the AR application.",

To address these issues and enable new ways to visualize, manipulate, and share virtual content, we introduce Augmented Augmented Reality (AAR) by combining a wearable AR display with a wearable spatial augmented reality projector. To explore this idea, a system is constructed to combine a head-mounted actuated pico projector with a Hololens AR headset. Projector calibration uses a modified structure from motion pipeline to reconstruct the geometric structure of the pan-tilt actuator axes and offsets. A toolkit encapsulates a set of high-level functionality to manage content placement relative to each augmented display and the physical environment. Demonstrations showcase ways to utilize the projected and head-mounted displays together, such as expanding field of view, distributing content across depth surfaces, and enabling bystander collaboration.",

An Augmented Reality (AR) based navigation system is created using the JAQL robot and an Google Pixel 2 Android smart phone. In developing this system, we aim to investigate the current capability of augmented reality as an all-in-one solution to indoor routing, localization, and object detection. Using Google's ARcore, we have developed a mobile application, which was used as both the sensor and the controller for the system. We highlight the features of ARcore and how they were applied to each of our navigation tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system and present results from a set of experiments in a real environment under varying conditions. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of our system and how we can make improvements in the future.",

While robot design based on subjective evaluation is useful, the problem of subject-based design is that the developer should prepare all variation of robots to be evaluated. Using AR, a developer can prepare robots using computer graphics. In addition, the AR technology makes it possible to evaluate a robot in an environment in which the robot is supposed to work. We conducted experiments to evaluate a robot's head size using both AR and real robots, and compared the evaluation results. As a result, similar evaluation results were obtained from both evaluation experiments, which showed a possibility of AR-based robot evaluation.",

An augmented reality based preoperative planning method is proposed to improve the safety of tele-neurosurgery. The position of four marks, which are attached on the head of patient and are used for surgeon to do preliminary preoperative planning with the support of sophisticated navigation software, is obtained by stereovision. Besides of the establishment of bilateral audio, video and data communications, the virtual simulation environment is calibrated and overlapped with the real live images. Using the augmented reality, the surgeon at remote site can conduct virtual surgery to find and verify the most appropriate and safest planning and then deliver his planning to surgery site. This method has been successfully applied in clinical cases of tele-neurosurgery.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel vision-based navigation strategy for autonomous humanoid robots using augmented reality (AR). In the first stage, a platform is developed for indoor and outdoor human location positioning and navigation using mobile augmented reality. The image sequence would be obtained by a smart phone's camera and the location information will be provided to the user in the form of 3D graphics and audio effects containing location information. To recognize a location, an image database and location model is pre-constructed to relate the detected AR-marker's position to the map of environment. The AR-markers basically act as active landmarks placed in undiscovered environments, sending out location information once detected by a camera. The second stage implements the same algorithm on an autonomous humanoid robot to be used as its navigation module. This is achieved by coupling the robot odometry and inertial sensing with the visual marker detection module. Using this system, the robot employs its vision system to enhance its localization robustness and allow quick recovery in lost situations by detecting the active landmarks or the so called AR-markers. The problem of motion blur resulting from the 6-DOF motion of humanoid's camera is solved using an adaptive thresholding technique developed to increase the robustness of the augmented reality marker detection under different illumination conditions and camera movements. For our experiments, we used the humanoid robot NAO and verified the performance of this navigation methodology in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Eating with others enhances our dining experience, improves socialization, and has some health benefits. Although many people do not want to eat alone, there is an increase in the number of people who eat alone in Japan due to difficulty in matching mealtimes and places with others.In this paper, we develop a mixed reality (MR) system for coeating with a robot. In this system, a robot and a MR headset are connected enabling users to observe a robot putting food image into its mouth, as if eating. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the developed system with users that are at least 13 years old. Experimental results show that the users enjoyed their meal and felt more delicious when the robot ate with them than when the robot only talked without eating. Furthermore, they eat more when a robot eats, suggesting that a robot could influence people’s eating behavior.",

    "abstract": "Getting a team of robots to achieve a relatively complex task using manual manipulation through augmented reality (AR) is interesting. However, the true potential of such an approach manifests when the system can learn from humans. We propose a system comprising a team of robots that performs a previously unseen task—a variant, to be specific—by learning from the sequences of actions taken by multiple human beings doing this task in various ways using deep learning (DL). The training inputs can be through actual manipulation of the team of robots using an augmented-reality tablet or through a simulator. Results indicate that the system is able to fulfill the specified variant of the task more than 80% of the time, inaccuracies mainly owing to unrealistic specifications of tasks. This opens up an avenue of training a team of robots, instead of crafting a rule base.",

    "abstract": "Training of robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery often includes supervised practice with a robotic surgical system. In this case, augmented reality can improve the communication between instructor and trainee, for example, by allowing the instructor to demonstrate skills with virtual surgical instruments that are shown to the trainee by means of augmented reality. However, virtual instruments are more difficult to handle than the real instruments---partly due to the lack of depth cues. In order to improve the usability of virtual surgical instruments, we compared five depth cues. Results showed both a preference for the artificial highlight cue and an aversion to transparency and depth of field. The highlight cue was therefore reviewed by experienced surgery instructors. These experts agreed that the highlight cue was beneficial and that the prototype could be used to some extent already and fully upon further development.",

    "abstract": "Teleoperated robot-assisted surgical systems provide surgeons with improved precision, dexterity, and visualization over traditional minimally invasive surgery. The addition of haptic (force and/or tactile) feedback has been proposed as a way to further enhance the performance of these systems. However, due to limitations in sensing and control technologies, implementing direct haptic feedback to the surgeon's hands remains impractical for clinical application. A new, intuitive augmented reality system for presentation of force information through sensory substitution has been developed and evaluated. The augmented reality system consists of force-sensing robotic instruments, a kinematic tool tracker, and a graphic display that overlays a visual representation of force levels on top of the moving instrument tips. The system is integrated with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) and tested by several users in a phantom knot tying task. The augmented reality system decreases the number of broken sutures, decreases the number of loose knots, and results in more consistent application of forces",

    "abstract": "Mixed reality (MR)opens up new vistas for human-robot interaction (HRI)scenarios in which a human operator can control and collaborate with co-located robots. For instance, when using a see-through head-mounted-display (HMD)such as the Microsoft HoloLens, the operator can see the real robots and additional virtual information can be superimposed over the real-world view to improve security, acceptability and predictability in HRI situations. In particular, previewing potential robot actions in-situ before they are executed has enormous potential to reduce the risks of damaging the system or injuring the human operator. In this paper, we introduce the concept and implementation of such an MR human-robot collaboration system in which a human can intuitively and naturally control a co-located industrial robot arm for pick-and-place tasks. In addition, we compared two different, multimodal HRI techniques to select the pick location on a target object using (i)head orientation (aka heading)or (ii)pointing, both in combination with speech. The results show that heading-based interaction techniques are more precise, require less time and are perceived as less physically, temporally and mentally demanding for MR-based pick-and-place scenarios. We confirmed these results in an additional usability study in a delivery-service task with a multi-robot system. The developed MR interface shows a preview of the current robot programming to the operator, e. g., pick selection or trajectory. The findings provide important implications for the design of future MR setups.",

    "abstract": "Among the countless applications of Augmented Reality (AR) in the industry, remote assistance represents one of the most prominent and widely studied use cases. Recently, the way in which assistance can be delivered started to evolve, unleashing the full potential of such technology. New methodologies have been proposed able to foster operators’ autonomy and reduce under-utilization of skilled human resources. This paper studies the effectiveness of a recently proposed approach to AR-based remote assistance, referred to as partially assisted, which differs from the traditional step-by-step guidance in the way the AR hints are conveyed by the expert to the operator. The suitability of this approach has been proved already for a number of simple industrial tasks, but a comprehensive study has yet to be performed for validating its effectiveness in complex use cases. This paper addresses this lack by considering as a case study the mastering of a robotic manipulator, a procedure involving a number of heterogeneous operations. The performance of the partially assisted approach is compared with step-by-step guidance based on both objective and subjective metrics. Results showed that the former approach could be particularly effective in reducing the time investment for the expert, allowing the operator to autonomously complete the assigned task in a time comparable to traditional assistance with a negligible need for further support.",

    "abstract": "In this paper the novel teleoperation method \"Hands-Free\" is presented. Hands-Free is a vision-based augmented reality system that allows users to teleoperate a robot end-effector with their hands in real time. The system leverages OpenPose neural network to detect the human operator hand in a given workspace, achieving an average inference time of 0.15 s. The user index position is extracted from the image and converted in real world coordinates to move the robot end-effector in a different workspace.The user hand skeleton is visualized in real-time moving in the actual robot workspace, allowing the user to teleoperate the robot intuitively, regardless of the differences between the user workspace and the robot workspace.Since a set of calibration procedures is involved to convert the index position to the robot end-effector position, we designed three experiments to determine the different errors introduced by conversion. A detailed explanation of the mathematical principles adopted in this work is provided in the paper.Finally, the proposed system has been developed using ROS and is publicly available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Krissy93/hands-free-project.",

    "abstract": "Robotic wheelchairs with built-in assistive features, such as shared control, are an emerging means of providing independent mobility to severely disabled individuals. However, patients often struggle to build a mental model of their wheelchair's behaviour under different environmental conditions. Motivated by the desire to help users bridge this gap in perception, we propose a novel augmented reality system using a Microsoft Hololens as a head-mounted aid for wheelchair navigation. The system displays visual feedback to the wearer as a way of explaining the underlying dynamics of the wheelchair's shared controller and its predicted future states. To investigate the influence of different interface design options, a pilot study was also conducted. We evaluated the acceptance rate and learning curve of an immersive wheelchair training regime, revealing preliminary insights into the potential beneficial and adverse nature of different augmented reality cues for assistive navigation. In particular, we demonstrate that care should be taken in the presentation of information, with effort-reducing cues for augmented information acquisition (for example, a rear-view display) being the most appreciated.",

    "abstract": "In previous work, researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that robots' use of deictic gestures enables effective and natural human-robot interaction. However, new technologies such as augmented reality head mounted displays enable environments in which mixed-reality becomes possible, and in such environments, physical gestures become but one category among many different types of mixed reality deictic gestures. In this paper, we present the first experimental exploration of the effectiveness of mixed reality deictic gestures beyond physical gestures. Specifically, we investigate human perception of videos simulating the display of allocentric gestures, in which robots circle their targets in users' fields of view. Our results suggest that this is an effective communication strategy, both in terms of objective accuracy and subjective perception, especially when paired with complex natural language references.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning based robot outdoor navigation method using visual information. The deep q network (DQN) maps the visual data to robot action in a goal location reaching task. An advantage of the proposed method is that the implemented DQN is trained in the first-person shooter (FPS) game-based simulated environment provided by ViZDoom. The FPS simulated environment reduces the differences between the training and the real environments resulting in a good performance of trained DQNs. In our implementation a marker-based augmented reality algorithm with a simple object detection method is used to train the DQN. The proposed outdoor navigation system is tested in the simulation and real robot implementation, with no additional training. Experimental results showed that the navigation system trained inside the game-based simulation can guide the real robot in outdoor goal directed navigation tasks.",

This paper reports on a collaborative user study, in which a local worker is guided by a remote expert with the help of different augmented reality methods, specifically see-through HMD, spatial projection, and video-mixing tablet. The task to perform is the exchange of a controller in a switch cabinet of an industrial robot, a task rather typical for failure detection within the field. Our study was conducted in collaboration with a technician school, where 50 technician apprentices participated in our study. Our results show clear advantages of using augmented reality (AR) versus traditional conditions (audio, video, screenshot) to enable remote support. It further gives significant indications for using a projection based AR method.",

    "abstract": "Ahstract-Robots operating alongside humans in field environments have the potential to greatly increase the situational awareness of their human teammates. A significant challenge, however, is the efficient conveyance of what the robot perceives to the human in order to achieve improved situational awareness. We believe augmented reality (AR), which allows a human to simultaneously perceive the real world and digital information situated virtually in the real world, has the potential to address this issue. Motivated by the emerging prevalence of practical human-wearable AR devices, we present a system that enables a robot to perform cooperative search with a human teammate, where the robot can both share search results and assist the human teammate in navigation to the search target. We demonstrate this ability in a search task in an uninstrumented environment where the robot identifies and localizes targets and provides navigation direction via AR to bring the human to the correct target.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in robotics, neuroscience, and signal processing make it possible to operate a robot through electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Although some successful attempts have been made in recent years, the practicality of the entire system still has much room for improvement. The present study designed and realized a robotic arm control system by combing augmented reality (AR), computer vision, and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-BCI. AR environment was implemented by a Microsoft HoloLens. Flickering stimuli for eliciting SSVEPs were presented on the HoloLens, which allowed users to see both the robotic arm and the user interface of the BCI. Thus users did not need to switch attention between the visual stimulator and the robotic arm. A four-command SSVEP-BCI was built for users to choose the specific object to be operated by the robotic arm. Once an object was selected, the computer vision would provide the location and color of the object in the workspace. Subsequently, the object was autonomously picked up and placed by the robotic arm. According to the online results obtained from twelve participants, the mean classification accuracy of the proposed system was 93.96 ± 5.05%. Moreover, all subjects could utilize the proposed system to successfully pick and place objects in a specific order. These results demonstrated the potential of combining AR-BCI and computer vision to control robotic arms, which is expected to further promote the practicality of BCI-controlled robots.",

    "abstract": "Policing of road traffic is listed in the most hazardous tasks since many traffic police personnel injured in a series of accidents at intersections. A life-size traffic cop robot called “IWI” is invented as an alternative to human traffic police in the street for directing traffic on point duty, and this paper proposes a human-robot cooperation scheme with wearable augmented glasses as an HMI to obtain a more immersing teleoperation experience with the aid of wearable augmented reality glasses. First, a humanoid robot is tailored for mobile surveillance with raspberry pi camera based eyes and omnidirectional Mecanum wheels. Second, the real-time video stream acquired by the on-site robot is distributed to multiple terminals, such as the central sever, the wearable augmented reality glasses and the mobile control tablet. Third, with a depth of focus estimation the augmented indications are displayed to aid to understand the remote scenario. Finally, the human policing results, such as STOP, PULL OVER, TURN-LEFT, are compiled and programmed as simplified patterns to control the robot body/hand pantomime. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology and control scheme is feasible in real-time application with high real-time performance of less than 0.5s latency, and open possibilities of easing the traffic jam via simultaneously scheduling multiple traffic cop robots.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral teleoperation using augmented reality is proposed for a multi-purpose robot called SpiderBot-II that is an indoor-installed wire-driven parallel manipulator. It is intended to be used for various applications, including in-house rehabilitation training and daily life assistance such as walking assistance and health monitoring, especially for the elderly or the handicapped that spends most of time at home. Through the teleoperation over the Internet, a therapist or an attendant in a remote site can give help to the physically disabled by directly manipulating the robot. For easy recognition of the obstacle, predefined markers are attached to each obstacle in the workspace. For better teleoperation, moreover, reaction force between obstacles and the end-effector, which is calculated using force field, is given to a remote operator and this enables the operator to perform the teleoperation more effectively. Force field, which is proportional to proximity between obstacles and the end-effector, is generated to facilitate the obstacle avoidance and visually augmented on the operator's screen for better recognition of obstacles.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method by which an assistive aerial robot can learn the relevant camera views within a task domain through tracking the head motions of a human collaborator. The human’s visual field is modeled as an anisotropic spherical sensor, which decays in acuity towards the periphery, and is integrated in time throughout the domain. This data is resampled and fed into an expectation maximization solver in order to estimate the environment’s visual interest as a mixture of Gaussians. A dynamic coverage control law directs the robot to capture camera views of the peaks of these Gaussians which is broadcast to an augmented reality display worn by the human operator. An experimental study is presented that assesses the influence of the assitive robot on reflex time, head motion, and task completion time.",

A significant challenge, however, is the efficient conveyance of what the robot perceives to the human in order to achieve improved situational awareness. We believe augmented reality (AR), which allows a human to simultaneously perceive the real world and digital information situated virtually in the real world, has the potential to address this issue. We propose to demonstrate that augmented reality can be used to enable human-robot cooperative search, where the robot can both share search results and assist the human teammate in navigating to a search target.",

    "abstract": "It is very likely that automated vehicles will have to operate in mixed traffic environments for a longer period in the future. To deploy highly automated vehicles (HAV) in urban mixed traffic, it is essential to be able to communicate externally with other human road users (drivers of non-automated vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians) and internally with the passenger of the HAV. Internal communication through an interior human machine interface (HMI) keeps the passenger informed about the HAV's automation state and actions, in order to build trust and enable a more comfortable ride experience. In this study, we explore augmented reality (AR) as part of an interior HMI for this purpose. We follow a user-centric approach with user research, prototyping, and user experience evaluation. Results suggest that the passengers of HAVs have specific information needs concerning surrounding traffic and the current driving situation. AR could help to serve this need, for instance by highlighting relevant objects in the driving scene.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots are often videotaped during operation, whether for later evaluation by their developers or for demonstration of the robots to others. Watching such videos is engaging and interesting. However, clearly the plain videos do not show detailed information about the algorithms running on the moving robots, leading to a rather limited visual understanding of the underlying autonomy. Researchers have resorted to following the autonomous robots algorithms through a variety of methods, most commonly graphical user interfaces running on offboard screens and separated from the captured videos. Such methods enable considerable debugging, but still have limited effectiveness, as there is an inevitable visual mismatch with the video capture. In this work, we aim to break this disconnect, and we contribute the ability to overlay visualizations onto a video, to extract the robot’s algorithms, in particular to follow its route planning and execution. We further provide mechanisms to create and visualize virtual adaptations of the real environment to enable the exploration of the behavior of the algorithms in new situations. We demonstrate the complete implementation with an autonomous quadrotor navigating in a lab environment using the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm. We briefly motivate and discuss our follow-up visualization work for our complex small-size robot soccer team.",

    "abstract": "One focus of augmented reality (AR) in robotics has been on enriching the interface for human-robot interaction. While such an interface is often made intuitive to interact with, it invariably imposes novel objects into the environment. In situations where the human already has a focus, such as in a human-robot teaming task, these objects can potentially overload our senses and lead to degraded teaming performance. In this paper, we propose using AR objects to solely augment natural objects to avoid disrupting our natural senses while adding critical information about the current situation. In particular, our case study focuses on addressing the limited field of view of humans by incorporating persistent virtual shadows of robots for maintaining situation awareness in proximal human-robot teaming tasks.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a modular-based implementation of augmented reality to provide an immersive experience in learning or teaching the planning phase, control system, and machining parameters of a fully automated work cell. The architecture of the system consists of three code modules that can operate independently or combined to create a complete system that is able to guide engineers from the layout planning phase to the prototyping of the final product. The layout planning module determines the best possible arrangement in a layout for the placement of various machines, in this case a conveyor belt for transportation, a robot arm for pick-and-place operations, and a computer numerical control milling machine to generate the final prototype. The robotic arm module simulates the pick-and-place operation offline from the conveyor belt to a computer numerical control (CNC) machine utilising collision detection and inverse kinematics. Finally, the CNC module performs virtual machining based on the Uniform Space Decomposition method and axis aligned bounding box collision detection. The conducted case study revealed that given the situation, a semi-circle shaped arrangement is desirable, whereas the pick-and-place system and the final generated G-code produced the highest deviation of 3.83 mm and 5.8 mm respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes TransformTable, an interactive digital table, whose shape can be physically and dynamically deformed. Shape transformations are mechanically and electrically actuated by wireless signals from a host computer. TransfomTable represents digital information in a physically changeable screen shape and simultaneously produces different spatial arrangements of users around the table. This provides visual information while changing the physical workspace to allow users to effectively handle their tasks. We implemented the first TransformTable prototype that can deform from/into one of three typical shapes: round, square, or rectangular. We also discuss implementation methods and further application designs and scenarios. A preliminary study shows fundamental and potential social impacts of the table transformation on users' subjective views in a group conversation.",

    "abstract": "Teleoperation provides a technical means to perform desired tasks in remote environments. Teleoperation using direct control and haptic-mediated interactions requires significant effort for unskilled users to understand how to operate the robot. Task-oriented teleoperation supports human-level understanding to directly transfer the meaning of tasks from the user to the robot. In this paper, we propose a natural 3D interface to transfer task knowledge to a remote robot. We design a 3D manipulation system in a mixed reality environment that combines human hand gestures and a 3D view of the remote robot. We demonstrate that the remote robot successfully executes the ordered task even in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel environment called RoboTable2 that supports users with limited programming knowledge or experience in conducting robot programming. We have devised a tabletop platform that can simultaneously recognize multi-touch input and track physical robots, enabling users to conduct robot-programming tasks in an intuitive manner. A user study comparing the proposed and a conventional graphical programming environment was conducted, involving ten university students with no programming experience. The effects of the proposed environment were clarified via video analysis, questionnaires and usage logs. A pilot study was also conducted to verify how easily users could design and develop applications on RoboTable2. The lessons learned with respect to design guidelines for the proposed programming environment and issues for investigation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "One of the open challenges in Human-Robot collaborative tasks is to provide a simple way for humans to understand robotic systems' plans and actions and to interact with them in the most natural way. Towards the direction of a natural interaction between human and robots, we propose a simple and intuitive interface exploiting the emergent Augmented Reality (AR) technology. This interface aims not only to enhance human awareness of the robot status and planned actions during collaborative tasks, but also to improve the quality of the work. The presented interface enables the human operators to interact with the system sending commands (gesture or vocal) and receive instant feedbacks (holograms and sound) through an AR device, enabling an intuitive way to coordinate human and robot actions. The interface validation is performed through two industrial scenario experiments, i.e., a collaborative assembly of a metallic structure and a collaborative polishing. The experimental results showed that the presented AR interface could be exploited to improve human operators' performance while performing an industrial task. At the same time the usage is also perceived as beneficial by ten subjects that tested the interface in the experiments.",

    "abstract": "Navigating through an unknown, and perhaps resource-constrained environment, such as Lunar terrain or through a disaster region can be detrimental - e.g. both physically and cognitively exhausting. Difficulties during navigation can cost time, operational resources, or even a life. To this end, the interaction with a robotic exploration system in lunar or Martian environments could be key to successful exploration extravehicular activities (X-EVA). Through the use of augmented reality (AR) we can afford an astronaut with various capabilities. In particular, we focus on two: (1) The ability to obtain and display information on their current position, on important locations, and on essential objects in an augmented space. (2) The ability to control an exploratory robot system, or smart robotic tools using AR interfaces. We present our ongoing development of such AR robot control interfaces and the feedback system being implemented. This work extends the augmented reality robot navigation and audio spatial feedback components presented at the 2020 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) SUITS Challenge.",

    "abstract": "Collaboration between computer graphics and multiple robots has attracted increasing attention in several areas. To preserve the seamless connection between them, the system needs to be able to accurately determine the position and state of the robots and be able to control them easily and instantly. However, realizing a responsive control system for a large number of mobile robots without complex settings and at the same time avoiding the system load problem is not trivial. Our system, called \"Phygital Field\", can project two types of information: visible images for humans and data patterns for mobile robots in the same location by utilizing pixel-level visual light communication (PVLC) technology. Phygital Field offers two technical innovations: an initialization-free and marker-free localization and control method, and a system noted for its simplicity and scalability. Phygital Field enables the robots to always recognize their own positions and states immediately, the measurement devices are not required because localization and control of the robots are realized through projection. These features are very important to improve the reconfigurability of the system. The idea of controlling robots by using information embedded in projected images allows users to easily design an integrated environment for the physical robots and digital images to preserve the seamless connection between them.",

    "abstract": "this work presents a control technique for Mobile Robot Navigation using augmented reality (AR). This navigation technique is based on optimized Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) and AR's Glyphs. AR's symbols are provided by the overhead camera. The patterns are made up of glyphs and a clear path. Six practical test are manipulated to examine the strength of optimizing FCM by a mobile robot for navigation with AR's symbols. The experiment examined the effectiveness of a Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWOA) in optimizing the FCM. Two practical experiments confirm that AR's Glyphs are an effective symbol for a robot to navigation in an unknown environment. A practical experiment reveals that a robot can use AR to manage its intended movement. Augmented reality, such as the Glyphs and a simplified map, are an effective tool for mobile robots to use in navigation in unknown environments. A prototype system is made to navigate the mobile robot by using AR and FCM.",

Virtual characters (possibly of a robotic genre) can offer highly expressive interfaces that are as convincing as a human, are comparably cheap and can be easily adapted and personalized. We introduce the notion of a mixed reality agent, i.e. an agent consisting of a physical robotic body and a virtual avatar displayed upon it. We realized an augmented reality interface with a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) in order to interact with such systems and conducted a pilot study to demonstrate the usefulness of mixed reality agents in human-robot collaborative tasks.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of a mobile service robot in domestic settings is a challenging task due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of such environments. Successful operation of the robot requires continuous human supervision to update its spatial knowledge about the dynamic environment. Thus, it is essential to develop a human-robot interaction (HRI) strategy that is suitable for novice end users to effortlessly provide task-specific spatial information to the robot. Although several approaches have been developed for this purpose, most of them are not feasible or convenient for use in domestic environments. In response, we have developed an augmented reality (AR) spatial referencing system (SRS), which allows a non-expert user to tag any specific locations on a physical surface to allocate tasks to be performed by the robot at those locations. Specifically, in the AR-SRS, the user provides a spatial reference by creating an AR virtual object with a semantic label. The real-world location of the user-created virtual object is estimated and stored as spatial data along with the user-specified semantic label. We present three different approaches to establish the correspondence between the user-created virtual object locations and the real-world coordinates on an a priori static map of the service area available to the robot. The performance of each approach is evaluated and reported. We also present use-case scenarios to demonstrate potential applications of the AR-SRS for mobile service robots.",

    "abstract": "As robots start to become ubiquitous in the personal workspace, it is necessary to have simple and intuitive interfaces to interact with them. In this paper, we propose an augmented reality (AR) interface for human-robot interaction (HRI) in a shared working environment. By fusing marker-based and markerless AR technologies, a mobile AR interface is created that enables a smartphone to detect planar surfaces and localize a manipulator robot in its working environment while obviating the need for a controlled or constrained environment. The AR interface and robot manipulator are integrated to render a system that enables users to perform pick-and-place task effortlessly. Specifically, a smartphone-based AR application is developed that allows a user to select any location within the robot's workspace by merely touching on the smartphone screen. Virtual objects, rendered at user-selected locations, are used to determine the pick and place locations of objects in the real world. The virtual object's start and end points, originally specified in the smartphone camera coordinate frame, are transformed into the robot coordinate frame for the robot manipulator to autonomously perform the assigned task. A user study is conducted with participants to evaluate the system performance and user experience. The results show that the proposed AR interface is user-friendly and intuitive to operate the robot, and it allows users to communicate their intentions through the virtual object easily.",

To achieve this even for untrained personnel, we propose the use of a Spatial Augmented Reality system to project the necessary information directly into the users' workspace. The projection system consists of a fixed as well as a mobile projector mounted directly on the manipulator, allowing for visualizing data anywhere in the surroundings of the robot. By enabling the user to simply see the necessary complex information he can better understand the data and behavior of the robotic assistant and has the opportunity to analyze and potentially optimize the working process. Together with an input device, arbitrary interfaces can be realized with the projection system.",

To examine the proposed method, we present an experiment based on assembling a modularised mobile-robot task called \"Buzz-Boards.\" A between-group design method was chosen for both the experimental and control groups in this study. Participants in the experimental group used an augmented reality application to help them assemble the robot, while the control group took a paper-based approach. 10 students from University of Essex were randomly assigned to each group, for a total of 20 students' participants. The evaluation factors for this study are time completion, a post-test, cognitive overload, and the learning effectiveness of each method. In overlay, assemblers who used the augmented reality application outperformed the assemblers who use the paper-based approach.",

    "abstract": "This work presents an overview of a new system to provide motion tracking and mixed reality integration of robots for use in K12 STEM education. The robots, commanded by students through a block-based programming environment, are placed in a virtual environment visible as an overlay on the physical space. The system’s control loop allows the robots to interact with virtual objects as if they are physically present within easily reconfigurable environments. This virtual space allows for lower cost robots to be used by incorporating virtual sensors and actuators, and creates the potential for a wider range of scenarios for students to work with.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel control system for the path planning of an omnidirectional mobile robot based on mixed reality. Most research on mobile robots is carried out in a completely real environment or a completely virtual environment. However, a real environment containing virtual objects has important actual applications. The proposed system can control the movement of the mobile robot in the real environment, as well as the interaction between the mobile robot’s motion and virtual objects which can be added to a real environment. First, an interactive interface is presented in the mixed reality device HoloLens. The interface can display the map, path, control command, and other information related to the mobile robot, and it can add virtual objects to the real map to realize a real-time interaction between the mobile robot and the virtual objects. Then, the original path planning algorithm, vector field histogram* (VFH*), is modified in the aspects of the threshold, candidate direction selection, and cost function, to make it more suitable for the scene with virtual objects, reduce the number of calculations required, and improve the security. Experimental results demonstrated that this proposed method can generate the motion path of the mobile robot according to the specific requirements of the operator, and achieve a good obstacle avoidance performance.",

However, with the number of smart devices raises the complexity of understanding and managing all devices and processes within one's vicinity. In this demo we present the HoloFlows mixed reality app, which allows users to directly explore, monitor and control physical devices within their surroundings. Simple workflows can be created between sensors and actuators to automate repetitive tasks in an end-user friendly way. We use gestural embodied interactions combined with real world metaphors to provide an intuitive and easy to learn interactive application for controlling complex CPS.",

    "abstract": "A robotic spatial augmented reality (RSAR) system combines robotics with spatial augmented reality (SAR) where cameras are used to recognize real objects, and projectors augment information and user interface directly on the surface of the real objects, rather than relying on mobile or wearable display devices. Hence, the control of a RSAR system requires handling of different types of control schemes at once such as classical inverse kinematics of simply linked bodies, inverse projections to find appropriate internal/external parameters of a projector, and geometric manipulation of a projection source image to increase the flexibility in control. In this paper, we outline a hybrid approach to control relevant control components in a coordinated manner, specially focused on application in a prototype RSAR system developed in ETRI.",

GENTORO differs from many existing systems in that children can make a robot play their own story in a physical space augmented by mixed-reality technologies. Pilot studies have been conducted to clarify the design requirements of GENTORO from both technological and practical viewpoints. A user study indicates that GENTORO's ability to enable manipulation of a robot using a handheld projector in a physical space can enhance children's embodied participation in, and their level of engagement with, their storytelling activities, and can support children in designing and expressing creative and original stories.",

To allow that human-robot interaction, we use an augmented reality display. This mechanism makes it possible to overlay planning, world model and sensory data provided by the robot over the same field of view. The determination of the camera pose in the AR system is solved using this novelty feature-based localisation method. Thus, the human user can intuitively help to build a topological map in an unknown environment by setting and manipulating map nodes and visualize and correct the robot's path planning",

    "abstract": "Prototyping devices with kinetic mechanisms, such as automata and robots, has become common in physical computing projects. However, mechanism design in the early-concept exploration phase is challenging, due to the dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of mechanisms. We present Mechanism Perfboard, an augmented reality environment that supports linkage mechanism design and fabrication. It supports the concretization of ideas by generating the initial desired linkage mechanism from a real world movement. The projection of simulated movement within the environment enables iterative tests and modifications in real scale. Augmented information and accompanying tangible parts help users to fabricate mechanisms. Through a user study with 10 participants, we found that Mechanism Perfboard helped the participant to achieve their desired movement. The augmented environment enabled intuitive modification and fabrication with an understanding of mechanical movement. Based on the tool development and the user study, we discuss implications for mechanism prototyping with augmented reality and computational support.",

We present a novel approach to mapping and cell setup using modern Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) that possess self-localisation and mapping capabilities. We leveraged these capabilities to create a point cloud of the environment and build an OctoMap - a voxel occupancy grid representation of the robot’s workspace for path planning. Through the use of Augmented Reality (AR) interactions, the user can edit the created Octomap and add safety zones. We perform comprehensive tests of the HoloLens’ depth sensing capabilities and the quality of the resultant point cloud. A high-end laser scanner is used to provide the ground truth for the evaluation of the point cloud quality. The amount of false-positive and false-negative voxels in the OctoMap are also tested.",

This paper reports the positive effects of augmented reality visual cues on operator performance during end-effector controlled tele-operation using only camera views. Our solution is to overlay a color-coded coordinate system on the end-effector of the robot using AR techniques. This mapped and color-coded coordinate system is then directly mapped to similarly color-coded joysticks used for control of both position and orientation. The AR view along with mapped markings on the joystick give the user a clear notion of the effect of their joystick movements on the end-effector of the robot. All camera views display this registered dynamic overlay information on-demand. An insertion task was used to compare performance with and without the coordinate mapping using fifteen subjects. Preliminary results indicate a significant reduction in distance and reversal errors",

In V.Ra, programmable mobile robots serve as binding agents to link the stationary IoTs and perform collaborative tasks. We establish an ecosystem that coherently connects the three key elements of robot task planning (human-robot-IoT) with one single AR-SLAM device. Users can perform task authoring in an analogous manner with the Augmented Reality (AR) interface. Then placing the device onto the mobile robot directly transfers the task plan in a what-you-do-is-what-robot-does (WYDWRD) manner. The mobile device mediates the interactions between the user, robot and IoT oriented tasks, and guides the path planning execution with the SLAM capability.",

Participants supervised a multi-UAV operation and the acquired spatial knowledge was evaluated using a Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). Moreover, a NASA-TLX study was done to measure the workload of each display. Finally, results showed that a gradual increase of immersion improved the spatial understanding of the UAV operator.",

    "abstract": "Expressivity–the use of multiple modalities to convey internal state and intent of a robot–is critical for interaction. Yet, due to cost, safety, and other constraints, many robots lack high degrees of physical expressivity. This paper explores using mixed reality to enhance a robot with limited expressivity by adding virtual arms that extend the robot’s expressiveness. The arms, capable of a range of non-physically-constrained gestures, were evaluated in a between-subject study (n =34) where participants engaged in a mixed reality mathematics task with a socially assistive robot. The study results indicate that the virtual arms added a higher degree of perceived emotion, helpfulness, and physical presence to the robot. Users who reported a higher perceived physical presence also found the robot to have a higher degree of social presence, ease of use, usefulness, and had a positive attitude toward using the robot with mixed reality. The results also demonstrate the users’ ability to distinguish the virtual gestures’ valence and intent.",

    "abstract": "Robots will play a vital role in our future personal spaces and we need to provide ways for robots and humans to interact with each other in a way that is natural, intuitive, descriptive and unambiguous. In this paper we introduce a framework that enables a human and robot to naturally interact and communicate with each other using the idea of diagrams. The diagrams are formed by a connected set of object markers placed in the environment. These markers can either be physically present in the environment or virtually present using marker-less technology. This paper presents a marker-less method for globally persistent markers. Diagrams are formed by connecting the objects together enabling the user to easily interact and control the robot in complex ways. We report on a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework and show how the framework can be used to program a robot to carry out navigation and action tasks within an environment.",

    "abstract": "We detail an approach to planning effective verbal feedback during pairwise human-robot task collaboration. The approach is motivated by social science literature as well as existing work in robotics and is applicable to a variety of task scenarios. It consists of a dynamic, synthetic task implemented in an augmented reality environment. The result is combined robot task control and speech production, allowing the robot to actively participate and communicate with its teammate. A user study was conducted to experimentally validate the efficacy of the approach on a task in which a single user collaborates with an autonomous robot. The results demonstrate that the approach is capable of improving both objective measures of team performance and the user’s subjective evaluation of both the task and the robot as a teammate.

In this paper, we describe a system prototype and a use case. The prototype is an augmented reality-based collaborative workspace. The envisioned solution is focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) where it should enable ordinary-skilled workers to program a robot on a high level of abstraction and perform collaborative tasks effectively and safely. The use case consists of a scenario and a persona, two methods from the field of HCI. We outline how we are going to use these methods in the near future to refine the task of the collaborating robot and human and the interface elements of the collaborative workspace.",

    "abstract": "Within the emerging research area represented by robotic gaming and, specifically, in application domains in which the recent literature suggests to combine commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) robots and projected mixed reality (MR) technology in order to develop engaging games, one of the crucial issues to consider in the design process is how to make the player perceive the robot as having a key role, i.e., to valorize its presence from the user experience point of view. By moving from this consideration, this paper reports efforts that are being carried out with the aim to investigate the impact of diverse game design choices in the above perspective, while at the same time extracting preliminary insights that can be exploited to orient further research in the field of MR-based robotic gaming and related scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Most robots consistently repeat their motion with- out changes in a precise and consistent manner. But nowadays there are also robots able to dynamically change their motion and plan according to the people and environment that surround them. Furthermore, they are able to interact with humans and cooperate with them. With no information about the robot targets and intentions, the user feels uncomfortable even with a safe robot. In close human-robot collaboration, it is very important to make the user able to understand the robot intentions in a quick and intuitive way. In this work we have developed a system to use augmented reality to project directly into the workspace useful information. The robot intuitively shows its planned motion and task state. The AR module interacts with a vision system in order to display the changes in the workspace in a dynamic way. The representation of information about possible collisions and changes of plan allows the human to have a more comfortable and efficient interaction with the robot. The system is evaluated in different setups.",

    "abstract": "The integration of augmented reality (AR) techniques in user interface design has enhanced interactive experiences in teleoperation of robots, hands-on learning in classrooms, laboratory, and special education, and user training in an array of fields, e.g., aerospace, automotive, construction, manufacturing, medical, etc. However, AR-based user interfaces that command machines and tools have not been fully explored for their potential to enhance interactive learning of engineering concepts in the laboratory. This paper outlines the development of a mobile application executing on a tablet device, which renders an immersive AR-based graphical user interface to enable users to monitor, interact with, and control a four-link underactuated planar robot. Computer vision routines are used to extract real-time, vision-based measurements of the robot's joint angles and end effector location from the live video captured by the rear-facing camera on the tablet. The obtained measurements are used to render AR content to offer users with additional visual feedback. Touch gesture recognition is implemented to allow users to naturally and intuitively command the robot by tapping and dragging their fingers at desired locations on the tablet screen. Experimental results show the performance and efficacy of the proposed system as it is operated in two different modes: one in which the user has direct control over the angles of the actuated links of the robot and one in which the user has direct control over the end effector location.",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether a user's background in computer programming has an influence on user's mental workload, when using a tablet-based augmented reality robot control interface that visualizes task-based information. For this purpose we conducted a user study, in which participants solved multiple robot control tasks. In the study, the users had to control a Sphero robot ball with the help of a tablet-based augmented reality (AR) interface. The AR interface was used to show task instructions to the user. The results of the study show that users with computer programming background had a higher effort and also report a higher frustration when using the AR interface. Additionally, they rate the usability of the AR interface as \"ok\", in comparison to naive users without programming background, who gave it a \"good\" rating. These results suggest that users with a computer programming background need an AR interface that visualizes more technical information.",

    "abstract": "This paper shares the experiences from the application of AR using the pro-cam robot assistant to managing children's play from three user perspectives, namely, the operator (teacher), the actors (children), and the audience (mainly children).\n First a preliminary expert survey was conducted to assess the expected benefits and any particular provisions needed both educationally and technically. Based on the expert survey, the original implementation was slightly modified, particularly for the robot control interface design for the teachers (e.g. to support easier multi-tasking). Finally, a formative evaluation and analysis was conducted to assess the educational effects to the children (both actors and audiences) and their attitudes when a pro-cam robot was used to run an AR based play, as compared to when a conventional approach was used.\n The study has found that robot-assisted AR based play showed improved learning effects, compared to the conventional play, in language and creativity and this is attributed to the operational flexibility, novelty, robotic mediation and capturing the attention of the children. The result was also made possible in part by designing an effective interface for the teachers to control the robots and manage the simultaneously occurring tasks.",

    "abstract": "With increasing autonomy, robots like drones are increasingly accessible to untrained users. Most users control drones using a low-level interface, such as a radio-controlled (RC) controller. For a wider adoption of these technologies by the public, a much higher-level interface, such as natural language or mixed reality (MR), allows the automation of the control of the agent in a goal-oriented setting. We present an interface that uses natural language grounding within an MR environment to solve high-level task and navigational instructions given to an autonomous drone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to perform fully autonomous language grounding in an MR setting for a robot. Given a map, our interface first grounds natural language commands to reward specifications within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Then, it passes the reward specification to an MDP solver. Finally, the drone performs the desired operations in the real world while planning and localizing itself. Our approach uses MR to provide a set of known virtual landmarks, enabling the drone to understand commands referring to objects without being equipped with object detectors for multiple novel objects or a predefined environment model. We conducted an exploratory user study to assess users’ experience of our MR interface with and without natural language, as compared to a web interface. We found that users were able to command the drone more quickly via both MR interfaces as compared to the web interface, with roughly equal system usability scores across all three interfaces.",

    "abstract": "A flexible endoscope introduces more dexterity to the image capturing in endoscopic surgery. However, manual control or automatic control based on instrument tracking does not handle the misorientation between the endoscopic video and the surgeon. We propose an automatic flexible endoscope control method that tracks the surgeon’s head with respect to the object in the surgical scene. The robotic flexible endoscope is actuated so that it captures the surgical scene from the same perspective as the surgeon. The surgeon wears a head-mounted display to observe the endoscopic video. The frustum of the flexible endoscope is rendered as an augmented reality overlay to provide surgical guidance. We developed the prototype, FlexiVision, integrating a 6-DOF robotic flexible endoscope based on the da Vinci Research Kit and Microsoft HoloLens. We evaluated the proposed automatic control method via a lesion observation task, and evaluated the AR surgical guidance in a lesion targeting task. The multi-user study results demonstrated that, for both tasks, FlexiVision significantly reduced the completion time (by 59% and 58%), number of errors (by 75% and 95%) and subjective task load level. With FlexiVision, the flexible endoscope could act as the surgeon’s eyes teleported into the abdominal cavity of the patient.",

    "abstract": "In socially assistive robotics, an important research area is the development of adaptation techniques and their effect on human-robot interaction. We present a meta-learning based policy gradient method for addressing the problem of adaptation in human-robot interaction and also investigate its role as a mechanism for trust modelling. By building an escape room scenario in mixed reality with a robot, we test our hypothesis that bi-directional trust can be influenced by different adaptation algorithms. We found that our proposed model increased the perceived trustworthiness of the robot and influenced the dynamics of gaining human’s trust. Additionally, participants evaluated that the robot perceived them as more trustworthy during the interactions with the meta-learning based adaptation compared to the previously studied statistical adaptation model.",

Often, these robots are operated by non-technical staff with no prior experience/education in robotics. Additionally, as with all new technology, there is certain reservedness when it comes to accepting robots in our personal space. In this work, we propose making use of state-of-the-art Mixed Reality (MR) technology to facilitate acceptance and interaction with mobile robots. By integrating a Microsoft HoloLens into the robot»s operating space, the MR device can be used to a) visualize the robot»s behavior-state and sensor data, b) visually notify the user about planned/future behavior and possible problems/obstacles of the robot, and c) to actively use the device as an additional external sensor source. Moreover, by using the HoloLens, users can operate and interact with the robot without being close to it, as the robot is able to sense with the users» eyes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in mixed-reality technologies have renewed interest in alternative modes of communication for human-robot interaction. However, most of the work in this direction has been confined to tasks such as teleoperation, simulation or explication of individual actions of a robot. In this paper, we will discuss how the capability to project intentions affect the task planning capabilities of a robot. Specifically, we will start with a discussion on how projection actions can be used to reveal information regarding the future intentions of the robot at the time of task execution. We will then pose a new planning paradigm - projection-aware planning - whereby a robot can trade off its plan cost with its ability to reveal its intentions using its projection actions. We will demonstrate each of these scenarios with the help of a joint human-robot activity using the HoloLens.",

    "abstract": "Embedded computing is often considered as a hidden technology where learners can require more assistance to inspect processes and activities hidden within the technologies, making use of debugging, monitoring, and visual tools. To the student, this kind of technology often has abstract behaviours where the only information/things people can see is the final action, and they do not know how the internal processes work and communicate inside the embedded computing device to achieve the desired result. Augmented reality (AR) can overcome this issue and produce a magic-lens view for revealing hidden embedded computing activities. This can result in learners achieving a better level of knowledge and awareness of the technology, as well as higher learning outcomes. AR on its own will not improve the learning processes without first considering how to manage and represent the hidden information. Therefore, a pedagogical virtual machine (PVM) model was employed, and to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed model. We conducted an experiment based on a problem-solving educational mobile robot task. Twenty students participated in the experimental (AR approach) and control (conventional approach) group. The result showed that the augmented reality approach was more effective in increasing students' computational thinking and learning outcomes. In addition, the augmented reality approach reduced both time completion and debugging times.",

To minimize downtime, we implemented three Augmented Reality (AR) visualizations (Path, Preview, and Volume) which allow users to understand robot motion intent and give way to the robot. We compare the different visualizations in a user study in which a small cognitive task is performed in a shared workspace. We found that Preview and Path required significantly longer head rotations to perceive robot motion intent. Volume, however, required the shortest head rotation and was perceived as most safe, enabling closer proximity of the robot arm before one left the shared workspace without causing shutdowns.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on two studies investigating how following a lead vehicle could act as a metaphor for an Augmented Reality (AR) system to support navigation tasks. For the first formative study, 34 participants completed a video-based evaluation of the role of a real lead vehicle when navigating a coherent journey. Verbal protocols indicated that a lead vehicle may be a valuable navigation aid at a range of different junction types, but not where drivers may desire a preview of upcoming steps or their overall orientation. A subsequent driving simulator study with 22 participants examined whether an AR lead vehicle may support drivers when navigating at complex junctions, specifically large multi-exit roundabouts. The virtual car led to good navigation and driving performance, which was comparable to a more traditional screen-fixed interface. Overall, this work demonstrates that a virtual lead vehicle may be beneficial within AR navigation devices.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to interaction between human workers and industrial collaborative robots. The proposed approach addresses problems introduced by existing solutions for robot programming. It aims to reduce the mental demands and attention switches by centering all interaction in a shared workspace, combining various modalities and enabling interaction with the system without any external devices. The concept allows simple programming in the form of setting program parameters using spatial augmented reality for visualization and a touch-enabled table and robotic arms as input devices. We evaluated the concept utilizing a user experience study with six participants (shop-floor workers). All participants were able to program the robot and to collaborate with it using the program they parametrized. The final goal is to create a distraction-free, usable and low-effort interface for effective human-robot collaboration, enabling any ordinary skilled worker to customize the robot's program to changes in production or to personal (e.g. ergonomic) needs.",

    "abstract": "Once a multi-robot system is implemented on real hardware and tested in the real world, analyzing its evolution and debugging unexpected behaviors is often a very difficult task. We present a tool for aiding this activity, by visualizing an Augmented Reality overlay on a live video feed acquired by a fixed camera overlooking the robot environment. Such overlay displays live information exposed by each robot, which may be textual (state messages), symbolic (graphs, charts), or, most importantly, spatially-situated; spatially-situated information is related to the environment surrounding the robot itself, such as for example the perceived position of neighboring robots, the perceived extent of obstacles, the path the robot plans to follow. We show that, by directly representing such information on the environment it refers to, our proposal removes a layer of indirection and significantly eases the process of understanding complex multi-robot systems. We describe how the system is implemented, discuss application examples in different scenarios, and provide supplementary material including demonstration videos and a functional implementation.",

    "abstract": "Mixed Reality (MR) is a promising interface for robot programming because it can project an immersive 3D visualization of a robot’s intended movement onto the real world. MR can also support hand gestures, which provide an intuitive way for users to construct and modify robot motions. We present a Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display (MRHMD) interface that enables end-users to easily create and edit robot motions using waypoints. We describe a user study where 20 participants were asked to program a robot arm using 2D and MR interfaces to perform two pick-and-place tasks. In the primitive task, participants created typical pickand-place programs. In the adapted task, participants adapted their primitive programs to address a more complex pickand-place scenario, which included obstacles and conditional reasoning. Compared to the 2D interface, a higher number of users were able to complete both tasks in significantly less time, and reported experiencing lower cognitive workload, higher usability, and higher naturalness with the MR-HMD interface.",

    "abstract": "Tactile feedback is pivotal for grasping and manipulation in humans. Providing functionally effective sensory feedback to prostheses users is an open challenge. Past paradigms were mostly based on vibro- or electrotactile stimulations. However, the tactile sensitivity on the targeted body parts (usually the forearm) is greatly less than that of the hand/fingertips, restricting the amount of information that can be provided through this channel. Visual feedback is the most investigated technique in motor learning studies, where it showed positive effects in learning both simple and complex tasks; however, it was not exploited in prosthetics due to technological limitations. Here, we investigated if visual information provided in the form of augmented reality (AR) feedback can be integrated by able-bodied participants in their sensorimotor control of a pick-and-lift task while controlling a robotic hand. For this purpose, we provided visual continuous feedback related to grip force and hand closure to the participants. Each variable was mapped to the length of one of the two ellipse axes visualized on the screen of wearable single-eye display AR glasses. We observed changes in behavior when subtle (i.e., not announced to the participants) manipulation of the AR feedback was introduced, which indicated that the participants integrated the artificial feedback within the sensorimotor control of the task. These results demonstrate that it is possible to deliver effective information through AR feedback in a compact and wearable fashion. This feedback modality may be exploited for delivering sensory feedback to amputees in a clinical scenario.",

    "abstract": "We design and develop a new shared Augmented Reality (AR) workspace for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), which establishes a bi-directional communication between human agents and robots. In a prototype system, the shared AR workspace enables a shared perception, so that a physical robot not only perceives the virtual elements in its own view but also infers the utility of the human agent—the cost needed to perceive and interact in AR—by sensing the human agent’s gaze and pose. Such a new HRI design also affords a shared manipulation, wherein the physical robot can control and alter virtual objects in AR as an active agent; crucially, a robot can proactively interact with human agents, instead of purely passively executing received commands. In experiments, we design a resource collection game that qualitatively demonstrates how a robot perceives, processes, and manipulates in AR and quantitatively evaluates the efficacy of HRI using the shared AR workspace. We further discuss how the system can potentially benefit future HRI studies that are otherwise challenging.",

    "abstract": "In our previous research, we showed that students using the educational robot Thymio and its visual programming environment were able to learn the important computer-science concept of event-handling. This paper extends that work by integrating augmented reality (AR) into the activities. Students used a tablet that displays in real time the event executed on the robot. The event is overlaid on the tablet over the image from a camera, which shows the location of the robot when the event was executed. In addition, visual feedback (FB) was implemented in the software. We developed a novel video questionnaire to investigate the performance of the students on robotics tasks. Data were collected comparing four groups: AR+FB, AR+non-FB, non-AR+FB, non-AR+non-FB. The results showed that students receiving feedback made significantly fewer errors on the tasks. Those using AR made fewer errors, but this improvement was not significant, although their performance improved. Technical problems with the AR hardware and software showed where improvements are needed.",

To accomplish this peer relationship, we propose to use the communication of information to the human and the autonomous robot teammate as a method of influencing their behavior. We use augmented reality technology to achieve a bidirectional communication of information between teammates. We outline multiple strategies for information communication from the autonomous robot to the human teammate. We examine these alternatives in the context of human-robot cooperative exploration of an unknown and uninstrumented environment. We present results from three experiments which show potential influence on human task performance in cooperative exploration.",

    "abstract": "The demand for mobile robots has rapidly increased in recent years due to the flexibility and high variety of application fields comparing to static robots. To deal with complex tasks such as navigation, they work with high amounts of different sensor data making it difficult to operate with for non-experts. To enhance user understanding and human robot interaction, we propose an approach to visualize the navigation stack within a cutting edge 3D Augmented Reality device -the Microsoft Hololens. Therefore, relevant navigation stack data including laser scan, environment map and path planing data are visualized in 3D within the head mounted device. Based on that prototype, we evaluate the Hololens in terms of computational capabilities and limitations for dealing with huge amount of real-time data. Results show that the Hololens is capable of a proper visualization of huge amounts of sensor data. We demonstrate a proper visualization of navigation stack data in 3D within the Hololens. However, there are limitations when transferring and displaying different kinds of data simultaneously.",

A Robot Operating System integrated framework is presented where a remote robot is controlled through operator's movements and muscle contractions captured with a wearable device. An augmented 3D visual feedback is sent to the user providing the remote environment scenario from the robot's point of view and additional information pertaining to the task execution. The system proposed, using robot mounted RGB-D camera, identifies known objects and relates their pose to robot arm pose and to targets relevant to the task execution. The system is preliminary validated during a pick-and-place task using a Baxter robot. The experiment shows the practicability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the presentation of a mixed-reality operational environment for carrying out experiments in robotics. This set up was designed as an intermediate system between a real and a simulated scenario in order to work with real robots and to ease and simplify the configuration and modification of the rest of the elements of the experiments. The environment uses video projection over the arena of the experiment, image capture to obtain the current position of the robots and a computer which monitors and controls the scenario. The graphic representation of the virtual elements of the scenario is projected onto the arena and their state is updated based on world rules of the experiment and on the state and actions of the robots. The scheme followed to control and structure this environment is based on the one proposed in a previous work for the creation of a simulation environment named Waspbed, which was designed for the study of simulated coevolution processes in multiagent systems. This setup is used for getting students from engineering degrees used to deal with robotics and all its associated fields, such as artificial vision, evolutionary robotics, communication protocols, etc. in a very simple, quick and cheap way, which otherwise wouldn't be feasible taking into account the academic constraints of time and resources.",

We provide the user with a view of the scene augmented with depth information from local cameras to provide visibility in occluded areas during manipulation tasks. This gives an improved sense of the 3D environment which results in better task performance. Further, we monitor the pose of the robot's end effector in real-time so that we are able to superimpose a virtual representation into the scene when parts are occluded. The integration of these features enables the user to perform difficult manipulation tasks when the action environment is normally occluded in the main camera view.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to simultaneously and coherently present visual and laser sensors information through an augmented reality visualization interface further enhanced by stereoscopic viewing. The use of graphical objects is proposed to represent proximity measurements which are superimposed and suitably aligned to video information through image processing. This new methodology enables an operator to quickly comprehend scene layout and dynamics, and to respond in an accurate and timely manner. Therefore the human-robot interaction is expected to be intuitive, accurate and fast. The use of graphical elements to assist teleoperation, sometime discussed in the literature, is here proposed following a systematic approach and developed based on authors' previous works on stereoscopic teleoperation. The approach is experimented on a real telerobotic system where a user operates a robot located approximately 3,000 kilometers apart. The results of a pilot test were very encouraging. They showed simplicity and effectiveness of the approach proposed and represent a base for further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Teaching robots new skills is considered as an important aspect of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). One challenge is that robots cannot communicate feedback in the same ways as humans do. This decreases the trust towards robots since it is difficult to judge, before the actual execution, if the robot has learned the task correctly. In this paper, we introduce an Augmented Reality (AR) based visualization tool that allows humans to verify the taught behavior before its execution. Our verification interface displays a virtual simulation embedded into the real environment, timely coupled with a semantic description of the current action. We developed three designs based on different interface/visualization-technology combinations to explore the potential benefits of enhanced simulations using AR over traditional simulation environments like RViz. We conducted a user study with 18 participants to assess the effectiveness of the proposed visualization tools regarding error detection capabilities. One of the advantages of the AR interfaces is that they provide more realistic feedback than traditional simulations with a lower cost of not having to model the entire environment.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel technology that allows real robots to perceive an augmented reality environment through virtual sensors. Virtual sensors are a useful and desirable technology for research activities because they allow researchers to quickly and efficiently perform experiments that would otherwise be more expensive, or even impossible. In particular, augmented reality is useful (i) for prototyping and assessing the impact of new sensors before they are physically produced; and (ii) for developing and studying the behaviour of robots that should deal with phenomena that cannot be easily reproduced in a laboratory environment because, for example, they are dangerous (e.g., fire, radiations). We realised an augmented reality system for robots in which a simulator retrieves real-time data on the real environment through a multi-camera tracking system and delivers post-processed information to the robot swarm according to each robot's sensing range. We illustrate the proposed virtual sensing technology through an experiment involving 15 e-pucks.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an augmented reality framework, implemented on the master console of a modified da Vinci® surgical robot, that enables the operator to design and implement assistive virtual fixtures during teleoperation. Our specific goal is to facilitate teleoperation with large time delays, such as the delay of several seconds that occurs with ground-based control of robotic systems in earth orbit. The virtual fixtures give immediate visual feedback and motion guidance to the operator, while the remote slave performs motions consistent with those constraints. This approach is suitable for tasks in unstructured environments, such as servicing of existing on-orbit spacecraft that were not designed for servicing. We conducted a pilot study by teleoperating a remote slave robot for a thermal barrier blanket cutting task using virtual fixtures with and without time delay. The results show that virtual fixtures reduce the time required to complete the task while also eliminating significant manipulation errors, such as tearing the blanket. The improvement in performance is especially dramatic when a simulated time delay (4 seconds) is introduced.",

This system takes advantage of MRI to enable users to visually program the robot through the augmented view of a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). In this paper, we first explain the design of the Mixed-Reality (MR) ready modular robotics system, which allows users to instantly perform MRI once they finish assembling the robot. Then, we elaborate the augmentations provided by the MR system in the three primary phases of a construction kit's lifecycle: Creation, Tweaking, and Usage. Finally, we demonstrate Ani-Bot with four application examples and evaluate the system with a two-session user study. The results of our evaluation indicate that Ani-Bot does successfully embed MRI into the lifecycle (Creation, Tweaking, Usage) of DIY robotics and that it does show strong potential for delivering an enhanced user experience.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a concept for human-robot interaction using techniques of virtual and augmented reality on mobile devices like cell phones and tablets or mixed reality devices like the HoloLens. By combining data received from real robots together with the perception and abilities of a human operator innovative applications are imaginable. Visualizing not only the current robot state but also the robots environment captured with different sensors and processed with both machine and human vision can lead to a rising percentage of robot assisted workplaces or robot installations. Since the visualization of and the interaction with the robotic application is not locally restricted new or improved use cases like remote maintenance or faster startup of industrial robots can be realized. Therefore, an architecture split into three functional units and an overview of our implementation is presented.",

    "abstract": "Social robots are gradually populating the human space. The utility of such robots is enormous. They can have socially important functions like training for kids with autism and molding the character and behavior of kids. The human-like features of social robots tend to elicit and maintain and enhance positive emotions in a child. The conclusive aim of social robotics is to develop robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. Making them more anthropomorphic is one of the main tasks in designing them. A humanoid robot requires an enormous amount of compactness of all actuators and sensors for expressing anthropomorphic characters. The cost and laboring required to meet these are huge. Also, some of their facial expressions and body movements do not need any physical interaction with the real world. Here comes the need of virtual robots which have the capability of showing a higher level of anthropomorphism. This paper presents a novel method for designing a low-cost android based social robot by replacing the actuators in humanoid robots and implementing virtual avatars instead. The paper contributes a novel integration methodology which combines a mobile robotic base and a virtual character using augmented reality.",

The main objective is to utilize the physical work environment as a canvas to communicate task-related instructions and robot intentions in the form of visual cues. A vision-based object-tracking algorithm is used to precisely determine the pose and state of physical objects in and around the workspace. A projection-mapping technique is employed to overlay visual cues on the tracked objects and the workspace. Simultaneous tracking and projection onto objects enable the system to provide just-in-time instructions for carrying out a procedural task.",

    "abstract": "Providing self-images is an effective approach to identifying sports players' body movements that should be corrected. Traditional means providing self-images, however, such as mirrors and videos, are not effective in terms of mobility and immediacy. In this paper we propose a system, Around Me, providing self-images through a display attached to an escort robot that runs in front of the user. This system captures the user's posture from the front and recognizes his/her position relative to the robot. The user's movements are synchronized with the robot's movements because the robot's movements are determined by the user's location. In this research we developed an experimental prototype specialized for assistance in jogging. In pilot studies we observed that the ability of Around Me to provide real-time images is potentially able to encourage the user to improve his/her jogging form, which is essential for performance and for injury prevention. In addition, compared with the robot running in front of the user with one following behind the user, we clarified the frontal robot's characteristics: the robot can control the jogging speed, and the user needs to adjust the robot's steering and the distance between the robot and him/her as he/she requires. Then we found indications that Around Me can, with various jogging support functions, encourage the user to practice jogging with ideal form.",

    "abstract": "The role of human-robot teaming (HRT), or the interaction between humans and robots to complete tasks, is becoming increasingly important in the modern age. From medicine to military applications, robots have established themselves as powerful tools in the completion of human-directed objectives. Given the importance of this teaming, it is equally important that there exists a system to develop such partnerships. For this purpose we present a tutorial based on the framework of the Project Aquaticus human-robot teaming test-bed, where participants in previous experiments felt overwhelmed while working with an autonomous robot teammate. To improve and develop this participant-robot relationship, we developed a tutorial for HRT using the Unity game engine. The Project Aquaticus test-bed centers around a game of capture-the-flag played in boats on the water, where each team is equipped with two human-steered boats and two autonomous robot teammates. The tutorial is designed based on the analysis of previous literature and includes features found in other, effective training systems and tutorials. The creation of this automated tutorial system shows promise in improving the effectiveness of HRT in the context of Project Aquaticus. In the near future, the effectiveness of this tutorial system will be tested with human subjects to evaluate improvements to situational awareness and cognitive load.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores how multi-modal body-syntonic interactive systems may be used to teach children to play the piano beyond the typical focus on reading musical scores and \"surface correctness\". Our work draws from Dalcroze Eurhythmics, a method of music pedagogy aimed at instilling an understanding of music rooted in the body. We present a Dalcrozian process of piano learning as a five-step iterative cycle of: listen, internalize, extend, analyze, and improvise. As a case study of how digital technologies may support this process, we present Andantino, a set of extensions of Andante, which projects musical lines as miniature light silhouettes that appear to walk on the keyboard of a player piano. We discuss features of Andantino based on each stage, or step, of the iterative framework and discuss directions for future research, based on two preliminary studies with children between the ages of 7 and 13.",

    "abstract": "The world is entering a new normal of hybrid organisations, in which it will be common that some members are co-located and others are remote. Hybridity is rife with asymmetries that affect our sense of belonging in an organisational space. This paper reports a study of an XR Telepresence technology probe to explore how remote workers might present themselves and be perceived as an equal and unique embodied being in a workplace. VROOM (Virtual Robot Overlay for Online Meetings) augments a standard Mobile Robotic Telepresence experience by (1) adding a virtual avatar overlay of the remote person to the local space, viewable through a HoloLens worn by the local user, through which the remote user can gesture and express themselves, and (2) giving the remote user an immersive 360° view of the local space, captured by a 360° camera on the robot, which they can view through a VR headset. We ran a study to understand how pairs of participants (one local and one remote) collaborate using VROOM in a search and word-guessing game. Our findings illustrate that there is much potential for a system like VROOM to support dynamic collaborative activities in which embodiment, gesturing, mobility, spatial awareness, and non-verbal expressions are important. However, there are also challenges to be addressed, specifically around proprioception, the mixing of a physical robot body with a virtual human avatar, uncertainties of others’ views and capabilities, fidelity of expressions, and the appearance of the avatar. We conclude with further design suggestions and recommendations for future work.",

Our goal is to build a new platform which can physically and directly emerge arbitrary bodies in the real world. iSphere flies by itself using a built-in drone and creates a spherical display by rotating arcuate multi light-emitting diode (LED) tapes around the drone. As a result of the persistence of human vision, we see it as a spherical display flying in the sky. The proposed method yields large display surfaces, high resolution, drone mobility, high visibility and 360° field of view. Previous approaches fail to match these characteristics, because of problems with aerodynamics and payload. We construct a prototype and validate the proposed method. The unique characteristics and benefits of flying spherical display surfaces are discussed and we describe application scenarios based on iSphere such as guidance, signage and telepresence.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of interactive technology, creating systems that allow users to define their interactive envelope freely and provide multi-interactive modalities is important to build up an intuitive interactive space. We present an indoor interactive system where a human can customize and interact through a projected screen utilizing the surrounding surfaces. An ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless sensor network was used to assist human-centered interaction design and navigate the self-actuated projector platform. We developed a UWB-based calibration algorithm to facilitate the interaction with the customized projected screens, where a hand-held input device was designed to perform mid-air interactive functions. Sixteen participants were recruited to evaluate the system performance. A prototype level implementation was tested inside a simulated museum environment, where a self-actuated projector provides interactive explanatory content for the on-display artifacts under the user’s command. Our results depict the applicability to designate the interactive screen efficiently indoors and interact with the augmented content with reasonable accuracy and relatively low workload. Our findings also provide valuable user experience information regarding the design of mobile and projection-based augmented reality systems, with the ability to overcome the limitations of other conventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "Novel approaches have taken Augmented Reality (AR) beyond traditional body-worn or hand-held displays, leading to the creation of a new branch of AR: Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) providing additional application areas. SAR is a rapidly emerging field that uses digital projectors to render virtual objects onto 3D objects in the real space. When mounting digital projectors on robots, this collaboration paves the way for unique Human-Robot Interactions (HRI) that otherwise would not be possible. Adding to robots the capability of projecting interactive Augmented Reality content enables new forms of interactions between humans, robots, and virtual objects, enabling new applications. In this work it is investigated the use of SAR techniques on mobile robots for better enabling this to interact in the future with elderly or injured people during rehabilitation, or with children in the pediatric ward of a hospital.",

But this method is not sufficient, because it allows people to only see the imaginary creatures. In Kobito: Virtual Brownies, imaginary creatures interact with the real world. They move real objects, and people interact with them through the real objects. The real objects function as a kind of ”haptic interface.” This technology can be used in the fields of design, amusement, and healthcare because it conveys haptic information in addition to the visual information that is delivered in current artificial life systems.",

    "abstract": "Visualizations such as bar charts help users reason about data, but are mostly screen-based, rarely physical, and almost never physical and dynamic. This paper investigates the role of physically dynamic bar charts and evaluates new interactions for exploring and working with datasets rendered in dynamic physical form. To facilitate our exploration we constructed a 10x10 interactive bar chart and designed interactions that supported fundamental visualisation tasks, specifically; annotation, filtering, organization, and navigation. The interactions were evaluated in a user study with 17 participants. Our findings identify the preferred methods of working with the data for each task i.e. directly tapping rows to hide bars, highlight the strengths and limitations of working with physical data, and discuss the challenges of integrating the proposed interactions together into a larger data exploration system. In general, physical interactions were intuitive, informative, and enjoyable, paving the way for new explorations in physical data visualizations.",

While various shape displays have been proposed, a common approach utilizes an array of linear actuators to form 2.5D surfaces. Through identifying a set of common interactions for viewing and manipulating content on shape displays, we argue why input modalities beyond direct touch are required. The combination of freehand gestures and direct touch provides additional degrees of freedom and resolves input ambiguities, while keeping the locus of interaction on the shape output. To demonstrate the proposed combination of input modalities and explore applications for 2.5D shape displays, two example scenarios are implemented on a prototype system.",

    "abstract": "Shape changing interfaces give physical shapes to digital data so that users can feel and manipulate data with their hands and bodies. However, physical objects in our daily life not only have shape but also various material properties. In this paper, we propose an interaction technique to represent material properties using shape changing interfaces. Specifically, by integrating the multi-modal sensation techniques of haptics, our approach builds a perceptive model for the properties of deformable materials in response to direct manipulation. As a proof-of-concept prototype, we developed preliminary physics algorithms running on pin-based shape displays. The system can create computationally variable properties of deformable materials that are visually and physically perceivable. In our experiments, users identify three deformable material properties (flexibility, elasticity and viscosity) through direct touch interaction with the shape display and its dynamic movements. In this paper, we describe interaction techniques, our implementation, future applications and evaluation on how users differentiate between specific properties of our system. Our research shows that shape changing interfaces can go beyond simply displaying shape allowing for rich embodied interaction and perceptions of rendered materials with the hands and body.",

First, we establish the design and fabrication approach for generating semi-solid reconfigurable surfaces. Secondly, we demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by presenting design sessions using datasets provided by experts from a diverse range of domains. Thirdly, we evaluate user engagement with the prototype hardware systems that are built. We learned that all participants, all of whom had no previous interaction with shape-changing displays, were able to successfully design interactive hardware systems that physically represent data specific to their work. Finally, we reflect on the content generated to understand if our approach is effective at representing intended output based on a set of user defined functionality requirements.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the term shape resolution, which adds to the existing definitions of screen and touch resolution. We propose a framework, based on a geometric model (Non-Uniform Rational B-splines), which defines a metric for shape resolution in ten features. We illustrate it by comparing the current related work of shape changing devices. We then propose the concept of Morphees that are self-actuated flexible mobile devices adapting their shapes on their own to the context of use in order to offer better affordances. For instance, when a game is launched, the mobile device morphs into a console-like shape by curling two opposite edges to be better grasped with two hands. We then create preliminary prototypes of Morphees in order to explore six different building strategies using advanced shape changing materials (dielectric electro active polymers and shape memory alloys). By comparing the shape resolution of our prototypes, we generate insights to help designers toward creating high shape resolution Morphees.",

But when music is captured and replayed across distance and time, the performer's body is rarely present. MirrorFugue conjures the recorded performer at the piano by combining the moving keys of a player piano with life-sized projection of the pianist's hands and upper body. Inspired by reflections on a lacquered grand piano, MirrorFugue evokes the sense that the virtual pianist is playing the physically moving keys. This video tells two stories of interactions across space and time mediated by MirrorFugue. One presents a great concert broadcasted across the world, where a young pianist learns by playing along. The other depicts a woman who plays a duet with her childhood self.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present Cellulo, a novel robotic platform that investigates the intersection of three ideas for robotics in education: designing the robots to be versatile and generic tools; blending robots into the classroom by designing them to be pervasive objects and by creating tight interactions with (already pervasive) paper; and finally considering the practical constraints of real classrooms at every stage of the design. Our platform results from these considerations and builds on a unique combination of technologies: groups of handheld haptic-enabled robots, tablets and activity sheets printed on regular paper. The robots feature holonomic motion, haptic feedback capability and high accuracy localization through a microdot pattern overlaid on top of the activity sheets, while remaining affordable (robots cost about 125 at the prototype stage) and classroom-friendly. We present the platform and report on our first interaction studies, involving about 230 children.",

Being quickly and flexibly deployed in open space, the Displaydrone allows the angle and direction of the projection to be adjusted on the fly. We realized the Displaydrone system with a custom-built octocopter, an off-the-shelf pico projector, an Android phone and went on flying. By carrying out an experimental evaluation we obtained first impressions on how the Displaydrone is perceived by a viewing audience. The paper highlights the findings and discusses the Displaydrone's potential for enabling new kinds of social group interactions in physical space.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for fast-moving aerial imaging using aerosol-based fog screens. Conventional systems of aerial imaging cannot move fast because they need large and heavy setup. In this study, we propose to add new tradeoffs between limited display time and payloads. This system employ aerosol distribution from off-the-shelf spray as a fog screen that can resist the wind, and have high portability. As application examples, we present wearable application and aerial imaging on objects with high speed movements such as a drone, a radio-controlled model car, and performers. We believe that our study contribute to the exploration of new application areas for fog displays and expand expressions of entertainments and interactivity.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the effects of the physical influence of a virtual human (VH) in the context of face-to-face interaction in augmented reality (AR). In our study, participants played a tabletop game with a VH, in which each player takes a turn and moves their own token along the designated spots on the shared table. We compared two conditions as follows: the VH in the virtual condition moves a virtual token that can only be seen through AR glasses, while the VH in the physical condition moves a physical token as the participants do; therefore the VH's token can be seen even in the periphery of the AR glasses. For the physical condition, we designed an actuator system underneath the table. The actuator moves a magnet under the table which then moves the VH's physical token over the surface of the table. Our results indicate that participants felt higher co-presence with the VH in the physical condition, and participants assessed the VH as a more physical entity compared to the VH in the virtual condition. We further observed transference effects when participants attributed the VH's ability to move physical objects to other elements in the real world. Also, the VH's physical influence improved participants' overall experience with the VH. We discuss potential explanations for the findings and implications for future shared AR tabletop setups.",

    "abstract": "We have created a unique telepresence system for communications and entertainment whereby users can share visual and sound information and express their feelings and impressions more directly than when using conventional meeting systems. We mainly focused on two features to create a unique avatar---its presence in the real world and its ability to interact with people---and created a system based on a blimp. Blimps are physical, not virtual, so they can be used as avatars in the real world. We installed a projector as the output function inside the blimp so that our system can work as a display and express the user's attributes. A camera and microphone mounted on the outside of the blimp provide the input function, which means the user can control the blimp from a distance through the network. The proposed system makes unique network communications between floating avatars and humans a legitimate possibility.",

    "abstract": "A laser pointer can be a powerful tool for robot control. However, in the past, their use in the field of robotics has been limited to simple target designation, without exploring their potential as versatile input devices. This paper proposes to create a laser pointer-based user interface for giving various instructions to a robot by applying stroke gesture recognition to the laser's trajectory. Through this interface, the user can draw stroke gestures using a laser pointer to specify target objects and commands for the robot to execute accordingly. This system, which includes lasso and dwelling gestures for object selection, stroke gestures for robot operation, and push-button commands for movement cancellation, has been refined from its prototype form through several user-study evaluations. Our results suggest that laser pointers can be effective not only for target designation but also for specifying command and target location for a robot to perform.",

We propose to augment the robot operator's visual space in order to avoid attention splitting and increase situational awareness (SA). In particular, we aim to improve on the SA concepts of perception, comprehension, and projection as well as the overall task performance. For that, we built upon the interaction design paradigm proposed by Walker et al.. On the one hand, our design augments the robot to support picking-tasks; and, on the other hand, we augment the environment to support placing-tasks. We evaluated our design in a first user study, and results point to specific design aspects that need improvement while showing promise for the overall approach, in particular regarding user satisfaction and certain SA concepts.",

    "abstract": "Although user interfaces with gesture-based input and augmented graphics have promoted intuitive human-robot interactions (HRI), they are often implemented in remote applications on research-grade platforms requiring significant training and limiting operator mobility. This paper proposes a mobile mixed-reality interface approach to enhance HRI in shared spaces. As a user points a mobile device at the robot's workspace, a mixed-reality environment is rendered providing a common frame of reference for the user and robot to effectively communicate spatial information for performing object manipulation tasks, improving the user's situational awareness while interacting with augmented graphics to intuitively command the robot. An evaluation with participants is conducted to examine task performance and user experience associated with the proposed interface strategy in comparison to conventional approaches that utilize egocentric or exocentric views from cameras mounted on the robot or in the environment, respectively. Results indicate that, despite the suitability of the conventional approaches in remote applications, the proposed interface approach provides comparable task performance and user experiences in shared spaces without the need to install operator stations or vision systems on or around the robot. Moreover, the proposed interface approach provides users the flexibility to direct robots from their own visual perspective (at the expense of some physical workload) and leverages the sensing capabilities of the tablet to expand the robot's perceptual range.",

    "abstract": "Applying masking tape to a particular area is a very important step for protecting an uninvolved surface in processes like mechanical part repairing or surface protection. In the past, the task was very time-consuming and required a lot of manual works. In recent years, with some advances in the fields of automatic robotic system and computer vision, the task now can be completed with the help of an automatic taping system containing a 3D scanner, a manipulator and a rotating platform. This implementation has been proved to provide better quality and be at least twice as fast as comparing to the work done by a human operator. However, there are still some limitations of this setup. First, it is difficult for the user to monitor the taping process since the system uses the 3D scanner to reconstruct the surface model and there is no calibrated projector to overlay the manipulator's trajectory over the real surface. Second, the main user is supposed to use a computer with keyboard and mouse to identify the area for masking which requires some expert knowledge and might not be appropriate in an industrial context where people wear protective equipment such as gloves or helmet. This paper introduces the use of spatial augmented reality technology and wearable device in the semi-automatic taping robotic system and the related calibration algorithms to enhance the user experience. The framework and its components are presented, with a case study and some results.",

    "abstract": "We present Kinetic AR, a holistic user experience framework for visual programming of robotic motion systems in Augmented Reality. The Kinetic AR framework facilitates human-robot collaboration in a co-located environment. Our goal is to present a deployable guide for the creation and visualization of manifold robotic interfaces while maintaining a low entry barrier to complex spatial hardware programming. A two phase validation process has been conducted to assess our work. As an initial phase, we have performed a set of interviews with robotics experts. Based on these interviews we have established three main areas that our framework tackles in different time domains. In a second phase, we have developed a set of prototypes using mobile Augmented Reality that apply the principles of Kinetic AR to multiple hardware actors including an AGV, a robotic arm, and a prosthetic system. Additional feedback from experts indicate the potential of the Kinetic ARframework.",

    "abstract": "Distance learning is facing a critical moment finding a balance between high quality education for remote students and engaging them in hands-on learning. This is particularly relevant for project-based classrooms and makerspaces, which typically require extensive trouble-shooting and example demonstrations from instructors. We present RobotAR, a teleconsulting robotics toolkit for creating Augmented Reality (AR) makerspaces. We present the hardware and software for an AR-compatible robot, which behaves as a student’s voice assistant and can be embodied by the instructor for teleconsultation. As a desktop-based teleconsulting agent, the instructor has control of the robot’s joints and position to better focus on areas of interest inside the workspace. Similarly, the instructor has access to the student’s virtual environment and the capability to create AR content to aid the student with problem-solving. We also performed a user study which compares current techniques for distance hands-on learning and an implementation of our toolkit.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) can serve as a tool to provide helpful information in a direct way to industrial robot programmers throughout the teaching process. It seems obvious that AR support eases the programming process and increases the programmer's productivity and programming accuracy. However, additional information can also potentially increase the programmer's perceived workload. To explore the impact of augmented reality on robot teaching, as a first step we have chosen a Sphero robot control scenario and conducted a within-subject user study with 19 professional industrial robot programmers, including novices and experts. We focused on the perceived workload of industrial robot programmers and their task completion time when using a tablet-based AR approach with visualization of task-based information for controlling a robot. Each participant had to execute three typical robot programming tasks: tool center point teaching, trajectory teaching, and overlap teaching. We measured the programmers' workload in the dimensions of mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, frustration, effort, and performance. The study results show that the presentation of task-based information in the tablet-based AR interface decreases the mental demand of the industrial robot programmers during the robot control process. At the same time, however, the programmers' task completion time increases.",

    "abstract": "As various home robots come into homes, the need for efficient robot task management tools is arising. Current tools are designed for controlling individual robots independently, so they are not ideally suitable for assigning coordinated action among multiple robots. To address this problem, we developed a management tool for home robots with a graphical editing interface. The user assigns instructions by selecting a tool from a toolbox and sketching on a bird's-eye view of the environment. Layering supports the management of multiple tasks in the same room. Layered graphical representation gives a quick overview of and access to rich information tied to the physical environment. This paper describes the prototype system and reports on our evaluation of the system.",

The advent of these devices (i.e., eye tracking glasses, virtual reality tools, etc.) provides the opportunity to create new, noninvasive forms of interaction between humans and robots. We show how a set of glasses equipped with gaze tracker, a camera, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can be used to estimate the relative position of the human with respect to a quadrotor, and decouple the gaze direction from the head orientation, which allows the human to spatially task (i.e., send new 3-D navigation waypoints to) the robot in an uninstrumented environment. We decouple the gaze direction from head motion by tracking the human's head orientation using a combination of camera and IMU data. In order to detect the flying robot, we train and use a deep neural network. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, and show that our pipeline has the potential to enable gaze-driven autonomy for spatial tasking. The proposed approach can be employed in multiple scenarios including inspection and first response, as well as by people with disabilities that affect their mobility.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an intuitive approach for collaborative robot end-user programming using a combination of interactive spatial augmented reality (ISAR) and headmounted display (HMD). It aims to reduce user’s workload and to let the user program the robot faster than in classical approaches (e.g. kinesthetic teaching). The proposed approach, where user is using a mixed-reality HMD – Microsoft HoloLens – and touch-enabled table with SAR projected interface as input devices, is compared to a baseline approach, where robot’s arms and a touch-enabled table are used as input devices. Main advantages of the proposed approach are the possibility to program the collaborative workspace without the presence of the robot, its speed in comparison to the kinesthetic teaching and an ability to quickly visualize learned program instructions, in form of virtual objects, to enhance the users’ orientation within those programs. The approach was evaluated on a set of 20 users using the within-subject experiment design. Evaluation consisted of two pick and place tasks, where users had to start from the scratch as well as to update the existing program. Based on the experiment results, the proposed approach is better in qualitative measures by 33.84% and by 28.46% in quantitative measures over the baseline approach for both tasks.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous and semi-autonomous mobile robots have been deployed to cooperate with humans in many industrial applications. These tasks require human and robot to communicate and present information quickly and effectively. Recent human-robot interfaces usually use a setup including a camera and a projector attached to the mobile robot to project the information to the floor or to the wall during the interaction process. However, there are some limitations to these interfaces. First, using a projector for projecting information seems to be fine for an indoor application. On the contrary, it is very difficult or even impossible for users to view this source of information in outdoor contexts. This makes the current framework inappropriate for many outdoor industrial tasks. Secondly, as the projector is the only device for exchanging information between human and robot, the human-robot interacting process is insecure and people who work in the same environment can control the robot in the same manner as the main operator. Finally, the current interfaces normally use mouse, keyboard or a teach pendant to provide task information to the robot. This approach poses some difficulties if the main operator is working in an industrial context where he is supposed to wear protective equipment such as gloves or helmets which make it hard to control a mouse or to type on a keyboard. This work proposes a new interface framework for human - computer interaction in industry that can overcome the current limitations of previous works. The framework uses a laser-writer instead of a projector which is suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications. Furthermore, the combination of see-through head-mounted display augmented reality and spatial augmented reality would provide the system a novel way to enhance the security level of exchanging information since the system now can separate the information presenting to the main user and to people working in the same environment. Finally, a novel hand-held device is incorporated to the framework which provides various input modalities for users to interact with the mobile robot. The device will allows the elimination of mouse and keyboard or teach pendants in industrial contexts.",

Therefore, user interfaces of cyber-physical systems involved in the production automation need to be well designed and taking into consideration the industrial application requirements. With the advances in augmented and virtual reality data visualization and novel interaction techniques like mid-air gestures, these approaches seem to be suitable for integration into the industry environment.

Modern manufacturing companies are shifting their focus from products to combined ecosystem of ProductsService Systems (PSS). Towards that end, the main objective of this work is to develop a cloud-based service-oriented system that implements AR technology for remote maintenance by enabling cooperation between the onspot technician and the manufacturer. The proposed system includes the methods for the record of the malfunction by the end user, the actions required by the expert so as to provide instructions in an Augmented Reality application for maintenance, as well as the cloudbased platform that will allow their communication and the exchange of information. In addition to the above, the proposed system consists of smart assembly/disassembly algorithms for automated generation of assembly sequences and AR scenes and improved interface, aiming to maximize existing knowledge usage while creating vivid AR service instructions. The proposed system is validated in a real-life case study following the requirements of a robotics SME. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "A visuo-haptic augmented reality (VHAR) interface is presented enabling an operator to teleoperate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a custom CdZnTe-based spectroscopic gamma-ray detector in outdoor environments. The task is to localize nuclear radiation sources, whose location is unknown to the user, without the close exposure of the operator. The developed detector also enables identification of the localized nuclear sources. The aim of the VHAR interface is to increase the situation awareness of the operator. The user teleoperates the UAV using a 3DOF haptic device that provides an attractive force feedback around the location of the most intense detected radiation source. Moreover, a fixed camera on the ground observes the environment where the UAV is flying. A 3D augmented reality scene is displayed on a computer screen accessible to the operator. Multiple types of graphical overlays are shown, including sensor data acquired by the nuclear radiation detector, a virtual cursor that tracks the UAV and geographical information, such as buildings. Experiments performed in a real environment are reported using an intense nuclear source.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the arising potential when automated path planning for aerial robotic structural inspection is combined with an Augmented Reality interface that provides live feed of stereo views fused with real-time 3D reconstruction data of the environment, while allowing seamless on-the-fly adaptation of the next robot viewpoints using intuitive head motions. The proposed solution aims to address the problem of accurate inspection and mapping of structures and environments for which a prior model exists but is not accurate, potentially outdated, or does not encode important features and semantics such as human-readable indications and other texture information. To approach the problem, the robot computes an optimized inspection path given any prior knowledge of the environment, while the human operator utilizes the live camera views and the real-time derived 3D map data to locally adjust the reference trajectory of the robot, such that it visits an updated set of viewpoints which provides the desired coverage of the real environment and sufficient focus on certain features and details. An autonomous aerial robot capable of navigation and mapping in GPS-denied environments is employed and combined with the Augmented Reality interface to experimentally demonstrate the potential of the approach in structural inspection applications.",

    "abstract": "Past research on shape displays has primarily focused on rendering content and user interface elements through shape output, with less emphasis on dynamically changing UIs. We propose utilizing shape displays in three different ways to mediate interaction: to facilitate by providing dynamic physical affordances through shape change, to restrict by guiding users with dynamic physical constraints, and to manipulate by actuating physical objects. We outline potential interaction techniques and introduce Dynamic Physical Affordances and Constraints with our inFORM system, built on top of a state-of-the-art shape display, which provides for variable stiffness rendering and real-time user input through direct touch and tangible interaction. A set of motivating examples demonstrates how dynamic affordances, constraints and object actuation can create novel interaction possibilities.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study on intention communication in a navigational context using a robotic wheelchair. The robotic wheelchair uses light projection to communicate its motion intentions. The novelty of the work is threefold: the communication of robot intentions to the passenger, the consideration of passenger and robot as a group (“in-group”) [1] who share motion intentions and the communication of the in-group intentions to other pedestrians (the “out-group”). A comparison in an autonomous navigation task where the robotic wheelchair autonomously navigates the environment with and without intention communication was performed showing that passengers and walking people found intention communication intuitive and helpful for passing by actions. Evaluation results significantly show human participant preference for having navigational intention communication for the wheelchair passenger and the person passing by it. Quantitative results show the motion of the person passing by the wheelchair with intention communication was significantly smoother compared to without intention communication.",

    "abstract": "Trained human co-workers can often easily predict each other's intentions based on prior experience. When collaborating with a robot coworker, however, intentions are hard or impossible to infer. This difficulty of mental introspection makes human-robot collaboration challenging and can lead to dangerous misunderstandings. In this paper, we present a novel, object-aware projection technique that allows robots to visualize task information and intentions on physical objects in the environment. The approach uses modern object tracking methods in order to display information at specific spatial locations taking into account the pose and shape of surrounding objects. As a result, a human co-worker can be informed in a timely manner about the safety of the workspace, the site of next robot manipulation tasks, and next subtasks to perform. A preliminary usability study compares the approach to collaboration approaches based on monitors and printed text. The study indicates that, on average, the user effectiveness and satisfaction is higher with the projection based approach.",

    "abstract": "Efficient motion intent communication is necessary for safe and collaborative work environments with collocated humans and robots. Humans efficiently communicate their motion intent to other humans through gestures, gaze, and social cues. However, robots often have difficulty efficiently communicating their motion intent to humans via these methods. Many existing methods for robot motion intent communication rely on 2D displays, which require the human to continually pause their work and check a visualization. We propose a mixed reality head-mounted display visualization of the proposed robot motion over the wearer's real-world view of the robot and its environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of this system against a 2D display visualization and against no visualization, we asked 32 participants to labeled different robot arm motions as either colliding or non-colliding with blocks on a table. We found a 16% increase in accuracy with a 62% decrease in the time it took to complete the task compared to the next best system. This demonstrates that a mixed-reality HMD allows a human to more quickly and accurately tell where the robot is going to move than the compared baselines.",

    "abstract": "Humans coordinate teamwork by conveying intent through social cues, such as gestures and gaze behaviors. However, these methods may not be possible for appearance-constrained robots that lack anthropomorphic or zoomorphic features, such as aerial robots. We explore a new design space for communicating robot motion in-tent by investigating how augmented reality (AR) might mediate human-robot interactions. We develop a series of explicit and implicit designs for visually signaling robot motion intent using AR, which we evaluate in a user study. We found that several of our AR designs significantly improved objective task efficiency over a base-line in which users only received physically-embodied orientation cues. In addition, our designs offer several trade-offs in terms of intent clarity and user perceptions of the robot as a teammate.",

    "abstract": "Teleoperating industrial manipulators in co-located spaces can be challenging. Facilitating robot teleoperation by providing additional visual information about the environment and the robot affordances using augmented reality (AR), can improve task performance in manipulation and grasping. In this paper, we present two designs of augmented visual cues, that aim to enhance the visual space of the robot operator through hints about the position of the robot gripper in the workspace and in relation to the target. These visual cues aim to improve the distance perception and thus, the task performance. We evaluate both designs against a baseline in an experiment where participants teleoperate a robotic arm to perform pick-and-place tasks. Our results show performance improvements in different levels, reflecting in objective and subjective measures with trade-offs in terms of time, accuracy, and participants’ views of teleoperation. These findings show the potential of AR not only in teleoperation, but in understanding the human-robot workspace.",

    "abstract": "Accurate drone positioning is challenging because pilots only have a limited position and direction perception of a flying drone from their perspective. This makes conventional joystick-based speed control inaccurate and more complicated and significantly degrades piloting performance. We propose PinpointFly, an egocentric drone interface that allows pilots to arbitrarily position and rotate a drone using position-control direct interactions on a see-through mobile AR where the drone position and direction are visualized with a virtual cast shadow (i.e., the drone’s orthogonal projection onto the floor). Pilots can point to the next position or draw the drone’s flight trajectory by manipulating the virtual cast shadow and the direction/height slider bar on the touchscreen. We design and implement a prototype of PinpointFly for indoor and visual line of sight scenarios, which are comprised of real-time and predefined motion-control techniques. We conduct two user studies with simple positioning and inspection tasks. Our results demonstrate that PinpointFly makes the drone positioning and inspection operations faster, more accurate, simpler and fewer workload than a conventional joystick interface with a speed-control method.",

    "abstract": "As domestic robots and smart appliances become increasingly common, they require a simple, universal interface to control their motion. Such an interface must support a simple selection of a connected device, highlight its capabilities and allow for an intuitive manipulation. We propose \"exTouch\", an embodied spatially-aware approach to touch and control devices through an augmented reality mediated mobile interface. The \"exTouch\" system extends the users touchscreen interactions into the real world by enabling spatial control over the actuated object. When users touch a device shown in live video on the screen, they can change its position and orientation through multi-touch gestures or by physically moving the screen in relation to the controlled object. We demonstrate that the system can be used for applications such as an omnidirectional vehicle, a drone, and moving furniture for reconfigurable room.",

The aim of the AR interface is to increase the intuitiveness and ease of robot programming. Marker tracking is used to automate sensor registration for easier workspace setup. Object recognition is employed to transform robot programming from an absolute coordinate system to an object-based system. This transformation provides flexibility to robot programming as the AR interface can be applied to workspaces that are configured differently to accomplish the same task. A spatially immersive display method is adopted to provide a projection-based direct overlay virtual workspace, so as to give users a better frame of reference in relation to the real workspace.",

    "abstract": "It is a challenging task for operators to program a remote robot for welding manipulation depending only on the visual information from the remote site. This paper proposes an intuitive user interface for programming welding robots remotely using augmented reality (AR) with haptic feedback. The proposed system uses a depth camera to reconstruct the surfaces of workpieces. A haptic input device is used to allow users to define welding paths along these surfaces. An AR user interface is developed to allow users to visualize and adjust the orientation of the welding torch. Compared with the traditional robotic welding path programming methods which rely on prior CAD models or contact between the robot end-effector and the workpiece, this proposed approach allows for fast and intuitive remote robotic welding path programming without prior knowledge of CAD models of the workpieces. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is a user-friendly interface and can assist users in obtaining an accurate welding path.",

Using a mixed reality head-mounted display (Microsoft Hololens) and a 7-DOF robot arm, we designed an augmented reality (AR) robotic interface with four interactive functions to ease the robot programming task: 1) Trajectory specification. 2) Virtual previews of robot motion. 3) Visualization of robot parameters. 4) Online reprogramming during simulation and execution. We validate our AR-robot teaching interface by comparing it with a kinesthetic teaching interface in two different scenarios as part of a pilot study: creation of contact surface path and free space path. Furthermore, we present an industrial case study that illustrates our AR manufacturing paradigm by interacting with a 7-DOF robot arm to reduce wrinkles during the pleating step of the carbon-fiber-reinforcement-polymer vacuum bagging process in a simulated scenario.",

We propose a novel HRC workflow that externalizes user's authoring as demonstrative and editable AR ghost, allowing for spatially situated visual referencing, realistic animated simulation, and collaborative action guidance. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW) based collaboration model which takes the real-time captured motion as inputs, maps it to the previously authored human actions, and outputs the corresponding robot actions to achieve adaptive collaboration. We emphasize an in-situ authoring and rapid iterations of joint plans without an offline training process. Further, we demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of our workflow through HRC use cases and a three-session user study.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an augmented reality-based method to increase human cognitive awareness of the danger/safety in the workspace of a variable impedance actuated (VIA) robot. Specifically, the \"safety aura\" around the robot was created using a safety/index defined for each point of the workspace. The safety-index is a composite metric incorporating the measurements of the distance from a point in the workspace to the VIA robot and the corresponding velocity during its motion. The safety aura is task-specific and is able to represent the safety levels in the workspace of the robot as it follows different trajectories. We developed a robot simulator which allows the visualization of the robot’s motion and assessment of the corresponding safety aura in 3D space. The generated safety aura was overlaid into mixed reality using Unity 3D platform together with Vuforia and web camera. Simulation results demonstrated the ability of the safety metric based on distance and velocity measurements to qualitatively assess the amount of danger. Our method has the potential to make the physical human robot interaction safer.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces swarm user interfaces, a new class of human-computer interfaces comprised of many autonomous robots that handle both display and interaction. We describe the design of Zooids, an open-source open-hardware platform for developing tabletop swarm interfaces. The platform consists of a collection of custom-designed wheeled micro robots each 2.6 cm in diameter, a radio base-station, a high-speed DLP structured light projector for optical tracking, and a software framework for application development and control. We illustrate the potential of tabletop swarm user interfaces through a set of application scenarios developed with Zooids, and discuss general design considerations unique to swarm user interfaces.",

    "abstract": "We must give some form of a command to robots in order to have the robots do a complex task. An initial instruction is required even if they do their tasks autonomously. We therefore need interfaces for the operation and teaching of robots. Natural languages, joysticks, and other pointing devices are currently used for this purpose. These interfaces, however, have difficulty in operating multiple robots simultaneously. We developed a multi-touch interface with a top-down view from a ceiling camera for controlling multiple mobile robots. The user specifies a vector field followed by all robots on the view. This paper describes the user interface and its implementation, and future work of the project.",

    "abstract": "Multipurpose wearable robots are an emerging class of devices, which offer intriguing interaction potential. The interoperability of multipurpose wearable robots and other types of wearable devices remains largely uninvestigated. We take the first steps to bridge this gap by presenting a framework for integrating augmented reality (AR) and multipurpose wearable robots. Our framework uses the publisher-subscriber model to expose different robot functionalities as services on a network. These can be invoked by the AR system. This model is advantageous in coping with different robot morphologies and various interaction methods. We implemented a prototype system using our framework by integrating an AR head-mounted display (HMD) and a wrist-worn robot, and demonstrate four experiences utilizing our prototype solution: 1) Robot status display, 2) shape-changing menus, 3) a media player and 4) a robot pose controller. To evaluate our approach, we performed a user study, which gauged user impressions and usability of developed experiences. Results indicate that our approach was well received, though participants highlighted a number of challenges in AR tracking when interacting within some of the experiences. Lastly, we discuss limitations and future research direction for our project.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the application of Augmented Reality (AR) for the control and adjustment of robots has been developed, with the aim of making interaction and adjustment of robots easier and more accurate from a remote location. A LeapMotion sensor based controller has been investigated to track the movement of the operator hands. The data from the controller allows gestures and the position of the hand palm’s central point to be detected and tracked. A Kinect V2 camera is able to measure the corresponding motion velocities in x, y, z directions after our investigated post-processing algorithm is fulfilled. Unreal Engine 4 is used to create an AR environment for the user to monitor the control process immersively. Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm is employed to fuse the position signals from the LeapMotion sensor with the velocity signals from the Kinect camera sensor, respectively. The fused/optimal data are sent to teleoperate a Baxter robot in real-time by User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Several experiments have been conducted to test the validation of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "A projected virtual hand interface, which visually extends arms of users using projection images, enables wheelchair users to reach unreachable objects; however, its projection area is narrower than the reaching area required for the users. To address this problem, we propose a wheelchair system enhanced with a projected virtual hand that allows controlling a projection area using user’s head orientation. The proposed system estimates the current orientation of a user’s head and controls the pan and tilt of a projector accordingly to move a projection area considering the positional relationship with a projection plane. As users can operate the projection area simply by turning their head, this operation can be executed simultaneously with operations of a virtual hand using their hands. We propose a control model for projector rotation according to the user’s head direction. The conducted user experience study has revealed that the proposed method enables users to perform pointing tasks in a shorter time compared with the existing method, and moreover, it has acceptable interface usability.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose to add a new system with valuable functionalities to vehicles. We call it \"Homunculus\". It is based on a new concept of interactions between humans and vehicles. It promotes and augments nonverbal communicability of humans in the vehicles.\n It is difficult to communicate with the drivers in the vehicles by eye contact, hand gestures or touching behavior. Our \"Homunculus\" is a system to solve these problems. The instruments of \"Homunculus\" are composed of three system modules. The First is Robotic Eyes System which is a set of robotic eyes that follows drivers eye movements & head rotations. The Second is Projection System which shows drivers hand gestures on the road. The Third is Haptic Communication System which consists of IR Distance Sensors Array on the vehicle and Vibration motors attached to the driver. It gives drivers the haptic sense to approaching objects to the vehicle. These three Systems are set on vehicle's hood or side.\n We propose the situation that humans and vehicles can be unified as one unit by Homunculus. This system works as a middleman for communications between men and vehicles, people in other cars, or even people just walking the street. We suggest the new relationship of men and their vehicles could be like men and their clothes.",

    "abstract": "Drones are becoming ubiquitous and offer support to people in various tasks, such as photography, in increasingly interactive social contexts. We introduce drone.io, a projected body-centric graphical user interface for human-drone interaction. Using two simple gestures, users can interact with a drone in a natural manner. drone.io is the first human-drone graphical user interface embedded on a drone to provide both input and output capabilities. This paper describes the design process of drone.io. We present a proof of concept, drone-based implementation, as well as a fully functional prototype for a drone tour-guide scenario. We report drone.io's evaluation in three user studies $(\\mathbf{N}=27)$ and show that people were able to use the interface with little prior training. We contribute to the field of human-robot interaction and the growing field of human-drone interaction.",

    "abstract": "Robot teleoperation can be a challenging task, often requiring a great deal of user training and expertise, especially for platforms with high degrees-of-freedom (e.g., industrial manipulators and aerial robots). Users often struggle to synthesize information robots collect (e.g., a camera stream) with contextual knowledge of how the robot is moving in the environment. We explore how advances in augmented reality (AR) technologies are creating a new design space for mediating robot teleoperation by enabling novel forms of intuitive, visual feedback. We prototype several aerial robot teleoperation interfaces using AR, which we evaluate in a 48-participant user study where participants completed an environmental inspection task. Our new interface designs provided several objective and subjective performance benefits over existing systems, which often force users into an undesirable paradigm that divides user attention between monitoring the robot and monitoring the robot’s camera feed(s).",

    "abstract": "In robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, the first assistant (FA) stands at the bedside assisting the intervention, while the surgeon sits at the console teleoperating the robot. Tasks for the FA include navigating new instruments into the surgeon’s field-of-view and passing in or retracting materials from the body using hand-held tools. We previously developed ARssist, an augmented reality application based on an optical see-through head-mounted display, to aid the FA. In this paper, we refine the system and first perform a pilot study with three experienced surgeons for two specific tasks: instrument insertion and tool manipulation. The results suggest that ARssist would be especially useful for less experienced assistants and for difficult hand-eye configurations. We then perform a multi-user study with inexperienced subjects. The results show that ARssist can reduce navigation time by 34.57%, enhance insertion path consistency by 41.74%, reduce root-mean-square path deviation by 40.04%, and reduce tool manipulation time by 72.25%. Thus, ARssist has the potential to improve efficiency, safety and hand-eye coordination, especially for novice assistants.",

    "abstract": "As robots begin to provide daily assistance to individuals in human environments, their end-users, who do not necessarily have substantial technical training or backgrounds in robotics or programming, will ultimately need to program and \"re-task\" their robots to perform a variety of custom tasks. In this work, we present PATI---a Projection-based Augmented Table-top Interface for robot programming---through which users are able to use simple, common gestures (e.g., pinch gestures) and tools (e.g., shape tools) to specify table-top manipulation tasks (e.g., pick-and-place) for a robot manipulator. PATI allows users to interact with the environment directly when providing task specifications; for example, users can utilize gestures and tools to annotate the environment with task-relevant information, such as specifying target landmarks and selecting objects of interest. We conducted a user study to compare PATI with a state-of-the-art, standard industrial method for end-user robot programming. Our results show that participants needed significantly less training time before they felt confident in using our system than they did for the industrial method. Moreover, participants were able to program a robot manipulator to complete a pick-and-place task significantly faster with PATI. This work indicates a new direction for end-user robot programming.",

    "abstract": "A core challenge in tabletop research is to support transitions between individual activities and team work. Shape-changing tabletops open up new opportunities for addressing this challenge. However, interaction design for shape-changing furniture is in its early stages - so far, research has mainly focused on triggering shape-changes, and less on the actual interface transitions. We present KirigamiTable - a novel actuated shape-changing tabletop for supporting transitions in collaborative work. Our work builds on the concept of Proxemic Transitions, considering the dynamic interplay between social interactions, interactive technologies and furniture. With KirigamiTable, we demonstrate the potential of interactions for proxemic transitions that combine transformation of shape and digital contents. We highlight challenges for shape-changing tabletops: initiating shape and content transformations, cooperative control, and anticipating shape-change. To address these challenges, we propose a set of novel interaction techniques, including shape-first and content-first interaction, cooperative gestures, and physical and digital preview of shape-changes.",

As a designer creates a new model using RoMA AR CAD editor, features are constructed concurrently by a 3D printing robotic arm sharing the same design volume. The partially printed physical model then serves as a tangible reference for the designer as she adds new elements to her design. RoMA's proxemics-inspired handshake mechanism between the designer and the 3D printing robotic arm allows the designer to quickly interrupt printing to access a printed area or to indicate that the robot can take full control of the model to finish printing. RoMA lets users integrate real-world constraints into a design rapidly, allowing them to create well-proportioned tangible artifacts or to extend existing objects. We conclude by presenting the strengths and limitations of our current design.",

    "abstract": "Wall displays almost universally assume a mostly flat and static shape. We ask two questions: Would people choose a flat display for a given interaction scenario and, if not, what are the display shapes they actually prefer? We conducted a design study around these two questions. Our results show that participants designed different screen shapes that varied based upon peoples' distance from the display and the content shown. Shapes ranged primarily between flat, separated, concave, L-shape and convex displays. Based on our findings, we designed a dynamic display that changes to these and other configurations. Shape-shifting is controlled either by explicit interaction (where the display responds to hand gestures) or implicitly (where the display infers a shape based both on its content and the sensed positions of the people around it). Overall, we contribute: a study that motivates research on shape-shifting wall displays, and a shape-shifting display system that responds to explicit and implicit controls to match particular activities.",

    "abstract": "We propose combining shape-changing interfaces and spatial augmented reality for extending the space of appearances and interactions of actuated interfaces. While shape-changing interfaces can dynamically alter the physical appearance of objects, the integration of spatial augmented reality additionally allows for dynamically changing objects' optical appearance with high detail. This way, devices can render currently challenging features such as high frequency texture or fast motion. We frame this combination in the context of computer graphics with analogies to established techniques for increasing the realism of 3D objects such as bump mapping. This extensible framework helps us identify challenges of the two techniques and benefits of their combination. We utilize our prototype shape-changing device enriched with spatial augmented reality through projection mapping to demonstrate the concept. We present a novel mechanical distance-fields algorithm for real-time fitting of mechanically constrained shape-changing devices to arbitrary 3D graphics. Furthermore, we present a technique for increasing effective screen real estate for spatial augmented reality through view-dependent shape change.",

    "abstract": "Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) transforms real-world objects into interactive displays by projecting digital content using video projectors. SAR enables co-located collaboration immediately between multiple viewers without the need to wear any special glasses. Unfortunately, one major limitation of SAR is that visual content can only be projected onto its physical supports. As a result, displaying User Interfaces (UI) widgets such as menus and pop-up windows in SAR is very challenging. We are trying to address this limitation by extending SAR space in mid-air. In this paper, we propose Drone-SAR, which extends the physical space of SAR by projecting digital information dynamically on the tracked panels mounted on a drone. DroneSAR is a proof of concept of novel SAR User Interface (UI), which provides support for 2D widgets (i.e., label, menu, interactive tools, etc.) to enrich SAR interactive experience. We also describe the implementation details of our proposed approach.",

We then motivate the need for a three dimensional display of faces to guarantee accurate delivery of gaze and directional movements and present Furhat, a novel, simple, highly effective, and human-like back-projected robot head that utilizes computer animation to deliver facial movements, and is equipped with a pan-tilt neck. After presenting a detailed summary on why and how Furhat was built, we discuss the advantages of using optically projected animated agents for interaction. We discuss using such agents in terms of situatedness, environment, context awareness, and social, human-like face-to-face interaction with robots where subtle nonverbal and social facial signals can be communicated. At the end of the chapter, we present a recent application of Furhat as a multimodal multiparty interaction system that was presented at the London Science Museum as part of a robot festival,. We conclude the paper by discussing future developments, applications and opportunities of this technology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to achieve projection mapping by mobile projector robot. Projection mapping technology become popular and is used in various situations. However, since most of the current projection mappings are based on pre-calibrated fixed projectors, projectable areas become small fixed regions. We have been researching Ubiquitous Display (UD) that is a mobile-projection robot and aims to support the users by projecting various information. In this paper, we propose projection mapping technology by the mobile projector robot. UD has sensors for self-localization, but their accuracy are not enough for achieving projection mapping. Thus, in our method, we first models projection target beforehand. Then, UD moves to the front of the target and obtains point cloud observations of the scene. After that, the pose and position of the model is estimated. By using the estimated pose and position, we can realize the accurate projection mapping based on the mobile projector. Preliminary experiment shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Interaction with a remote team of robots in real time is a difficult human-robot interaction (HRI) problem exacerbated by the complications of unpredictable real-world environments, with solutions often resorting to a larger-than-desirable ratio of operators to robots. We present two innovative interfaces that allow a single operator to interact with a group of remote robots. Using a tabletop computer the user can configure and manipulate groups of robots directly by either using their fingers (touch) or by manipulating a set of physical toys (tangible user interfaces). We recruited participants to partake in a user study that required them to interact with a small group of remote robots in simple tasks, and present our findings as a set of design considerations.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in 3D user interfaces pushes towards immersive graphics and actuated shape displays. Our work explores the hybrid of these directions, and we introduce sublimation and deposition, as metaphors for the transitions between physical and virtual states. We discuss how digital models, handles and controls can be interacted with as virtual 3D graphics or dynamic physical shapes, and how user interfaces can rapidly and fluidly switch between those representations. To explore this space, we developed two systems that integrate actuated shape displays and augmented reality (AR) for co-located physical shapes and 3D graphics. Our spatial optical see-through display provides a single user with head-tracked stereoscopic augmentation, whereas our handheld devices enable multi-user interaction through video seethrough AR. We describe interaction techniques and applications that explore 3D interaction for these new modalities. We conclude by discussing the results from a user study that show how freehand interaction with physical shape displays and co-located graphics can outperform wand-based interaction with virtual 3D graphics.",

    "abstract": "We introduce shape-changing swarm robots. A swarm of self-transformable robots can both individually and collectively change their configuration to display information, actuate objects, act as tangible controllers, visualize data, and provide physical affordances. ShapeBots is a concept prototype of shape-changing swarm robots. Each robot can change its shape by leveraging small linear actuators that are thin (2.5 cm) and highly extendable (up to 20cm) in both horizontal and vertical directions. The modular design of each actuator enables various shapes and geometries of self-transformation. We illustrate potential application scenarios and discuss how this type of interface opens up possibilities for the future of ubiquitous and distributed shape-changing interfaces.",

We describe preliminary results from a formative study on how designers communicate and collaborate in design meetings around physical and digital artifacts. Addressing some limitations in current collaboration platforms and drawing guidelines from our study, we introduce a new prototype platform for remote collaboration. This platform leverages the use of augmented reality (AR) for rendering of the remote participant and a pair of linked actuated tabletop tangible interfaces that acts as the participant’s shared physical workspace. We propose the use of actuated tabletop tangibles to synchronously render complex shapes and to act as physical input.",

    "abstract": "Drones allow exploring dangerous or impassable areas safely from a distant point of view. However, flight control from an egocentric view in narrow or constrained environments can be challenging. Arguably, an exocentric view would afford a better overview and, thus, more intuitive flight control of the drone. Unfortunately, such an exocentric view is unavailable when exploring indoor environments. This paper investigates the potential of drone-augmented human vision, i.e., of exploring the environment and controlling the drone indirectly from an exocentric viewpoint. If used with a see-through display, this approach can simulate X-ray vision to provide a natural view into an otherwise occluded environment. The user's view is synthesized from a three-dimensional reconstruction of the indoor environment using image-based rendering. This user interface is designed to reduce the cognitive load of the drone's flight control. The user can concentrate on the exploration of the inaccessible space, while flight control is largely delegated to the drone's autopilot system. We assess our system with a first experiment showing how drone-augmented human vision supports spatial understanding and improves natural interaction with the drone.",

    "abstract": "We present a new technique for human-robot interaction called robot expressionism through cartooning. We suggest that robots utilise cartoon-art techniques such as simplified and exaggerated facial expressions, stylised text, and icons for intuitive social interaction with humans. We discuss practical mixed reality solutions that allow robots to augment themselves or their surroundings with cartoon art content. Our effort is part of what we call robot expressionism, a conceptual approach to the design and analysis of robotic interfaces that focuses on providing intuitive insight into robotic states as well as the artistic quality of interaction. Our paper discusses a variety of ways that allow robots to use cartoon art and details a test bed design, implementation, and exploratory evaluation. We describe our test bed, Jeeves, which uses a Roomba, an iRobot vacuum cleaner robot, and a mixed-reality system as a platform for rapid prototyping of cartoon-art interfaces. Finally, we present a set of interaction content scenarios which use the Jeeves prototype: trash Roomba, the recycle police, and clean tracks, as well as initial exploratory evaluation of our approach.",

For the local user, an augmented-reality (AR) interface shows a life-size avatar of the remote user overlaid on a telepresence robot. For the remote user, a head-mounted virtual-reality (VR) interface presents an immersive 360° view of the local space with mobile autonomy. The VR system tracks the remote user's head pose and hand movements, which are applied to an avatar. This provides the remote user with an identifiable self-embodiment and allows the local user to see the remote user's head direction and arm gestures.",

Unlike humans, many robots do not continuously produce perceivable state-expressive sounds. In this work, we propose the use of iconic auditory signals that mimic the sounds produced by a robot’s operations. In contrast to artificial sounds (e.g., beeps and whistles), these signals are primarily functional, providing information about the robot’s actions and state. We analyze the effects of two variations of robot sound, tonal and broadband, on auditory localization during a human-robot collaboration task. Results from 24 participants show that both signals significantly improve auditory localization, but the broadband variation is preferred by participants. We then present a computational formulation for auditory signaling and apply it to the problem of auditory localization using a human-subjects data collection with 18 participants to learn optimal signaling policies.",

    "abstract": "The video game industry revolutionized the game market from the 1970s onwards. Stationary video game machines, such as “coin-ops” and, later, consoles for home entertainment made it possible to experience and interact with new virtual environments. Based on technical innovations, early video games already included different graphic and auditory effects that were used to present and emphasize the spatial dimension of game stories. One of the most famous and successful video game series that “told” spatial stories and included many visualizations of virtual topographies was Nintendo’s Super Mario series. Nintendo developed diverse video game topographies including different interactive and animated cartographic media throughout the Super Mario series. These maps were early and fundamental examples that were user-friendly and suitable for children. Moreover, they established a basis for future video game spaces, and the techniques used to create, animate, and visualize these maps have also found their ways into other applications of cartography and geomatics. It seems that the early worlds of Super Mario animated cartographers to animate cartographic visualizations. This article presents the characteristic spatial structures and cartographic techniques found in early Super Mario games, from the arcade classic Donkey Kong (1981) to the Super Nintendo classic Super Mario Kart (1992). The meaning of these structures and techniques for other cartographic applications is discussed. RÉSUMÉ: L’industrie des jeux vidéo a révolutionné le marché des jeux depuis les années 1970. Les appareils de jeux vidéo fixes, comme les « bornes d’arcade », et les consoles de jeux domestiques par la suite ont permis d’expérimenter de nouveaux environnements virtuels et d’interagir avec ces environnements. Grâce aux innovations techniques, les premiers jeux vidéo comportaient déjà différents éléments graphiques et auditifs servant à présenter et à mettre en valeur la dimension spatiale des scénarios de jeu. L’une des séries vidéoludiques les plus connues et les plus populaires proposant des scénarios spatiaux et de multiples visualisations de topographies virtuelles était la série de Nintendo Super Mario. Nintendo a mis au point diverses topographies de jeux vidéo, dont différents outils cartographiques interactifs et animés dans la série Super Mario. Ces cartes étaient la manifestation précoce et fondamentale d’un souci de convivialité et d’adaptation aux enfants. Elles jetaient en outre les bases des univers futurs des jeux vidéo, et les techniques permettant de créer, d’animer et de visualiser ces cartes ont également été transposées à d’autres applications de la cartographie et de la géomatique. Il semble que les premiers pas de Super Mario aient incité les cartographes à animer les représentations cartographiques. Les auteurs présentent les structures spatiales et les techniques cartographiques caractéristiques des premières versions des jeux Super Mario, du classique des jeux d’arcade Donkey Kong (1981) au classique du Super Nintendo Super Mario Kart (1992). Ils analysent la signification de ces structures et de ces techniques dans la perspective d’autres applications techniques.",

    "abstract": "CALLAS project aims at designing and developing an integrated multimodal architecture able to include emotional aspects to support applications in the new media business scenario with an “ambient intelligence” paradigm. The project is structured in three main areas: the \"Shelf\", collecting multimodal affective components (speech, facial expression and gesture recognition); the \"Framework\", a software infrastructure enabling the cooperation of multiple components with an easy interface addressed to final users; and three \"Showcases\" addressing three main fields of new media domain: AR art, Entertainment and Digital Theatre, Interactive Installation in public spaces and Next Generation Interactive TV. INTRODUCTION – THE CALLAS PROJECT CALLAS Conveying Affectiveness in Leading-edge Living Adaptive Systems is an Integrated Project founded by the European Commission within the 6 Framework Programme Information Society Technologies priority, in the strategic objective Multimodal Interfaces (2.5.7). The project started in November 2006 and will end in May 2010. The project consortium is composed of universities and private research laboratories working on multimodal applications, together with artists, broadcasts and theatres, involved as final users [1]. MULTIMODAL AFFECTIVE INTERFACES: OBJECTIVES AND DOMAIN In everyday life, human communication combines speech with gestures, movements, and non-verbal expressions: each of those communication channels is affected by emotions. Taking in consideration the role of emotions and affectiveness is therefore fundamental to enrich naturalness also in human-machine interaction and communication. The CALLAS project face the challenges of implementing innovative affective interfaces to comprehend emotional input within the domain of interactive media. Affective and emotional interfaces are generally concerned with the real-time identification of user emotions to determine system response. They usually rely on Ekmanian emotions such as anger, fear, sadness, enjoyment, disgust and surprise. The domain of interactive new media, such as interactive narratives, digital theatre or digital arts, involves different ranges of emotions on the user’s side, some of which correspond to responses to aesthetic properties of the media, or characterize the user experience itself in terms of enjoyment and entertainment. To identify these ranges of EVA 2008 London Conference ~ 22-24 July Massimo Bertoncini Irene Buonazia _____________________________________________________________________ 20 emotions, more complex articulations of modalities are required across semantic dimensions as well as across temporal combinations. For instance, input from emotional language and paralinguistic speech (laughter, cries) must be categorized as indicators of user attention and must be integrated across interaction sessions of variable durations, instead of analyzing a single emotional status in real-time. The first scientific CALLAS objective is to advance the state-of-the-art in Multimodal Affective Interfaces, by creating new emotional models, able to take into account a comprehensive user experience in Digital Arts and Entertainment applications, and by developing new modalities to capture these new emotional categories. The main technological research (developed by the universities and research labs participating in the project) consists in the development and integration of advanced software components for semantic recognition of emotions. Those components will be available through a “living” repository, called the CALLAS “shelf”. On the other side, the project (mainly with the effort of the software and engineering companies of the consortium) aims at establishing a software methodology for the development and the engineering of a \"framework\" for Multimodal Interfaces that will make their development accessible to a larger community of users (even without a deep understanding of the theories of Multimodality), represented in the consortium by theatres, broadcasts and digital artists. Finally, the effectiveness of CALLAS approach will be validated developing research prototypes in the domain of digital media, arts and entertainment. In recent years, new media has developed largely in terms of richness of digital contents (combining text, video and sound) and of technical sophistication. On the other hand, emerging technologies, such as ubiquitous computing, augmented and virtual reality, human-computer interaction, and context and location-awareness, are making possible a paradigm embracing users’ natural behaviour as the centre of humancomputer interaction. Most New Media are actually interactive, and rely on digital content for which user interaction plays a central role. The domain of digital cultural content (digital theatre, mixed reality arts, ubiquitous systems supporting interactive storytelling and TV) is specially challenging, involving a wide range and combination of sophisticated users’ emotions and feelings. This particular domain chosen by CALLAS imposes to advance the understanding of emotional interaction, taking into account also non-Ekmanian emotional categories. CALLAS COMPONENTS: THE SHELF The Shelf consists of a dynamic pool of advanced multimodal interface technologies, selected taking into special account efficiency and robustness, in order to guarantee a consistent performance for many contexts and scenarios, specially for the use in uncontrolled “production” scenarios, while many technologies are developed and tested in controlled settings. CALLAS shelf components include: Emotional Speech Recognition: combines keyword spotting in utterances with information about the emotional state of the speaker, according to correspondences with a list of Ekmanian and non-Ekmanian emotions (component specially developed by Faculté Polytechnique de Mons); Emotional Natural Language Understanding (developed by University of Augsburg): includes acoustic as well as linguistic features, relying on a corpus-driven approach; EVA 2008 London Conference ~ 22-24 July Massimo Bertoncini Irene Buonazia _____________________________________________________________________ 21 Sound Capture and Analysis (component developed by VTT): maps on emotional patterns speech, surrounding sounds (music, crowd cheering), to guarantee natural and adaptive interaction with physical and virtual environment, as well as in the creation of MR/AR environments; Video Feature Extraction: extracts contextual and emotional information about users, environment and media from video streams combining audio and visual information. The component especially analyses video streaming on wide spaces, tracking speed, direction and quantity of movement of items in the space; Gesture and Body Motion Tracking (developed by VTT): provides information about body movement and gestures interpreted as thresholds to different emotional states. The tracking, especially focussing on hands movements, will be performed with different sensors positioned from upper limb to the whole body; Haptic Tracking component is a 3D haptic tracker for virtual environment navigation, based on interpretation of force/tactile feedback (developed by Humanware); it will be further developed into Wearable Interfaces for Motion Capture, embedding different miniaturized transducers for gesture recognition and motion tracking; Multimodal Interpretation of User Experience (developed by University of Teesside) researches on the emotional categorisation of the user experience, aiming at defining a new paradigm for investigating emotions in multimodal interfaces; Affective Multimodal Interpreter / Facial Expression Recognition extracts expressivity from gaze detection, facial features (measured through coordinates of interest point in the face), and gesture recognition (measured through head-hands coordinates). Such components, operating on high-resolution images of frontal faces and signals coming from many sensors, are developed by ICCS. The output of such researches should be an Expressivity Synthesis, able to generate, from image sequences, sensors, history and personality details, an expressive model of user’s behaviour, to be performed by ECA. Emotional Natural Language Generation component (to be developed as a research output of the project by University of Augsburg) is responsible for generating natural language without disregarding the affective aspects of a conversation. It is based on an annotated corpus consisting of sentences that present typical expressions used in a conversation. The corpus has to be annotated with categories and topics that the sentences are about and also with the emotional state that they denote. Affective Music Synthesis (developed by University of Reading) component aims at enhancing musicality and music expression of virtual actors according to the user’s mood, making users' experience of sound and music less mechanical. Emotional Attentive ECA (Embodied conversational agents, based on achievements of ECA developed by University of Paris8), will investigate on three core capabilities of ECA in emotional and social context: emotional communication through gesture, facial expression, gaze, body; emotional expression in a social context by blending or masking emotions; modelling perceptual-attentive social behaviours that are a basis for interaction, such as mutual, joint and shared attention. THE CALLAS INTEGRATED APPROACH: THE FRAMEWORK The aim of the CALLAS project is to develop a system able to combine emotional components and features in new modalities, enabling different modes of integration, as required by various applications, offering pre-assembled, re-usable, and semantic fusion EVA 2008 London Conference ~ 22-24 July Massimo Bertoncini Irene Buonazia _____________________________________________________________________ 22 components.

    "abstract": "Adroid1 enables users to borrow precision and accuracy from a robotic arm when using hand-held tools. When a tool is mounted to the robot, the user can hold and move the tool directly—Adroid measures the user’s applied forces and commands the robot to move in response. Depending on the tool and scenario, Adroid can selectively restrict certain motions. In the resulting interaction, the robot acts like a virtual “jig” which constrains the tool’s motion, augmenting the user’s accuracy, technique, and strength, while not diminishing their agency during open-ended fabrication tasks. We complement these hands-on interactions with projected augmented reality for visual feedback about the state of the system. We show how tools augmented by Adroid can support hands-on making and discuss how it can be configured to support other tasks within and beyond fabrication.",

    "abstract": "A general remote controlled robot is manipulated by a joystick and a gamepad. However, these methods are difficult for inexperienced users because the mapping between the user input and resulting robot motion is not always intuitive (e.g. tilt a joystick to the right to rotate the robot to the left). To solve this problem, we propose a touch-based interface for remotely controlling a robot from a third-person view, which is called “TouchMe”. This system allows the user to manipulate each part of the robot by directly touching it on a view of the world as seen by a camera looking at the robot from a third-person view. Our system provides intuitive operation, and the user can use our system with minimal user training. In this paper we describe the TouchMe interaction and its prototype implementation. We also introduce three scheduling methods for controlling the robot in response to user interaction and report on the results of empirical comparisons of these methods.",

To ensure the safety of users for such scenarios, we propose a novel Virtual Barrier system facilitated by an augmented reality interface. Our system provides two kinds of Virtual Barriers to ensure safety: 1) a Virtual Person Barrier which encapsulates and follows the user to protect them from colliding with the robot, and 2) Virtual Obstacle Barriers which users can spawn to protect objects or regions that the robot should not enter. To enable effective human-robot collaboration, our system includes an intuitive robot programming interface utilizing speech commands and hand gestures, and features the capability of automatic path re-planning when potential collisions are detected as a result of a barrier intersecting the robot’s planned path. We compared our novel system with a standard 2D display interface through a user study, where participants performed a task mimicking an industrial manufacturing procedure. Results show that our system increases the user’s sense of safety and task efficiency, and makes the interaction more intuitive.",

    "abstract": "Social robots have an enormous potential for educational applications and allow for cognitive outcomes that are similar to those with human involvement. Remotely controlling a social robot to interact with students and peers in an immersive fashion opens up new possibilities for instructors and learners alike. Using immersive approaches can promote engagement and have beneficial effects on remote lesson delivery and participation. However, the performance and power consumption associated with the involved devices are often not sufficiently contemplated, despite being particularly important in light of sustainability considerations. The contributions of this research are thus twofold. On the one hand, we present telepresence solutions for a social robot’s location-independent operation using (a) a virtual reality headset with controllers and (b) a mobile augmented reality application. On the other hand, we perform a thorough analysis of their power consumption and system performance, discussing the impact of employing the various technologies. Using the QTrobot as a platform, direct and immersive control via different interaction modes, including motion, emotion, and voice output, is possible. By not focusing on individual subsystems or motor chains, but the cumulative energy consumption of an unaltered robot performing remote tasks, this research provides orientation regarding the actual cost of deploying immersive robotic telepresence solutions.",
